Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,The last good cod. RIP TT
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Very Nice Game But Alot of hackers ruin it
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,VAC of Duty: Valve Trollers 2.  True story.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Still playing in 2017. Great game.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,PLS Fix ONLINE i cant play online?
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"still my fav COD game, on the Xbox-360 i played easily 600+ hours on this game... OLD IS BETTER!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Multiplayer is very entertaining. Story mode is one of my favorites, and Spec Ops is decent. Provides a very nostalgic feeling if you had this game back in the day."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,campaign feels too real compared to other cods
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Is good stuff!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,It Good Because Of Modded Lobby
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This is by far the best Call of Duty Games i have ever played.  The story mixed with the guns and shooting and  everything else makes a very good shooting game. This is  it. The graphics are clean and smooth for the year 2009, The story is just the most amazing story ive seen. The Modern Warfare franchise is the best.  I Highly recommend this game, its worth it, every penny."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Still has some players and is more fun and playable than console for some reason but i dont understand why people say they got banned for using FOV changers when i know of heaps of people who use them and isnt an advanctage is just makes the game playable and not like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ console game on a pc, one of the best cod games along with black ops 1, 2, modern warfare 1 (cod4) and world at war, all those games are great but this one has the best campaign and better spec ops missions than mw3 and the guns are all great and is super fun to mess around on with friends in mp  10 out of 10"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,I recommend this game for all cod fans. But in this moment there is a lot of banned hackers and cheaters and there is a lot of good players - like me Kappa
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,This is the best Call Of Duty GAME!!!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,old but gold.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I only played for a little while, but so far it has been fun"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,best call of duty made and no FUTURE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Best call of duty
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,After 7 years still one of the best war game. Nice story and nice handling.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,It's very cool game!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,good game if you play like a boss you are pro
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,This is so great i licked the screen
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Great game, only bad point is, that dedicated servers are missing"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Taught me how to live life to the fullest by qu1ksc0p31ng all the ladies
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I like the storyline of the game, but on my pc the subtitles are blurred and the menus are illegible. But, its a great game. :)"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This was the COD that blew the franchise up, let it set records and become the most revered franchise in the FPS market. This isnt becasue the game was 'good' but instead becasue it was addictive. So really this isnt the 'best shooter ever'. Its more like the most addictive shooter ever.  Crack Cocaine out of 10, would snort this again."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Best call of duty ever for the quickscoping community, even beats mw3 but it's rly close!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Destroyed my academic records and social life since 2009 11/10 never ever tried this game
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Memories... You should absolutely buy it if you didn't...
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,This game is easily one of the best (if not the best) COD games imo. The only con in MW2 is the people that keep spamming noobtubes with one man army but this game is definetly recommendable to anyone who loves first person shooters.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,BEST GAME EVER 10/10 IGN!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Nice game but cant find a multi game under 200 ping
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"played the campaigns as a little kid and played through the spec ops with my older brother on his Xbox 360. loved this game and years later after finely tuning my multiplayer skills playing other cod games, i came to get this on sale and made a High Level Prestiged player rage quit. only have 30 minutes of multiplayer but coming back to this amaing game is just fantastic. thank you to the community for keeping this game alive."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"By far my favorite CoD game! The best and most memorable CoD campaign with an epic soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer. The co-op mode, spec-ops, is a series of challenges set in places from the campaign but with a twist. You can also play spec-ops single player but it's far more fun with a friend. The multiplayer used to be amazing back in it's prime sadly now it's hard to find a full online game. Or for that sake an online game at all, and even then there's hackers everywhere! Overall this game holds up VERY well for being 7 years old, i just wish the multiplayer was as lively as it used to be. My final score for the game's current state would have to be 8.5/10."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,It's fun to come on with some cheats and do some modded lobby shannanigans :D
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Will always be, and still is the 2nd best PC COD multiplayer game (amongst the MW and Treyarch series). And of course, MW1 would be the 1st."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"A great classic for any COD fan. Great story,  Great Multiplayer Great Game.  9.7/10 Recommended"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Trickshots for days
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I haven't played this game a lot, but it's good."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,The best multiplayer of Call of Duty!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Why this is one of the only CoD games that truly deserve your time and money: For the first time in the Call of Duty series, the infamous veteran mode is actually a fair challenge. Enemy placement is rational, said enemies are no longer just aimbots with brain damage, and they no longer endlessly respawn. The visuals (at least for the time) are impressive. Especially the character models.  There are some great over the top moments to experience during the campaign. You'll fly over a mountain on a snow mobile, chase the enemy down the rapids in a speedboat, and of course; listen to Prisoner 627's suicide run speech towards the end of the game. An awesome bit of sillyness.  Whilst not dragging the game down too much, the multi-player side is, unfortunately, a different story. Unlike CoD4, there are no dedicated servers, so matches suffer from bad lag spikes, and good luck finding anyone playing outside of team deathmatch and free for all. Spec Ops is the better option. This mode allows you to play an alternative version of select single player missions from both Modern Warfare, and Modern Warfare 2. Either solo or with a friend. My personal favourite is Hidden. A co-op version of the Chernobyl mission from CoD4.  This is the last Call of Duty title (with the exception of maybe Black Ops 2) that actually tried to evolve the franchise above the level of an interactive movie. Definitely gets my recommendation."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Great Game. 
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,This was by far the best cod ever made.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I got my stats hacked to prestige mode, I was only level 12 and now I'm at level 1 again ;-; (SO MANY HACKED SERVERS) Never play Free for all Never play ground war Never Play domination Always Play TDM"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Step 1: Buy Game Step 2: Have to go into the game files just to delete 1 thing to even launch multiplayer Step 3: Rage at multiplayer  10/10 Rage Sim 2069
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,best call of duty ive played
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I haven't played the single player of this game since playing it on the Xbox 360 and I have to say, it is just as enthralling as the first time I played it.  Multiplayer aside, I knew I was buying this mainly for the single player, but even after all these years it still hasn't dissapointed. If it isn't getting infuriated at friendlies walking into my line of fire, it's them telling me to check it because I was firing at an enemy and they happened to wander in front of me.  would totally recommend this game."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,no players - 69/69
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,I JUST LOVE IT
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,IT is cool but alot of moders but thats it. it is a great game and cool
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Good but old....
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,great game m9
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Like all other COD games other than the multiplayer, the best part is the campaign. I must say that the group at Infinity Ward has really outdone themselves on newest COD campaigns. The campaign itself is so real, and so dramatic that it makes you love each character in your squad. Jumping back and forth between members of the CIA, 141, and the Army Rangers the overall plot is very exciting and also easy to follow. Many times the tables will turn to situations you never saw coming. "
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,One of the most revolutionary FPS' of all time and they decided not to have dedicated servers. Aside from that the campaign is fun and full of great moments.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,SPOILERS!!!!!!!                       All i have to say is.........Rest in Piece Roach and Ghost you were good men.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,the longest call of duty story ever in the history of call of duty's
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,It's epic!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,I made the worst mistake of my life i refunded it not thinking. :(
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Remember, no Russian."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,I LOVE IT. Its a nice game. Not the biggest fan of campanign but i love multiplayer. Multiplayer is awesome it has lots of hours of fun.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Awesome multiplayer game! enjoyed a lot!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,One of the best call of duty
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Honestly one of the best games ive ever played, both the multiplayer and the single player were great additions to my collection of games. The game has loads of content to be explored and this game is/was pretty dam addicting"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"amazing game, most people think its full of hackers but its not.   campain mode meh, i find the airport mission offensive.  the reason you should get this game is. the multiplayer  also a good and easy to get weapon for all levels is scar-h dot sight       "
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,vac banned for no reason. i love ya lots valve but...fix the damn vac system PLEASE  other than that SPEC OPS is fun and so is sp and MP (even tho i can only play on non vac secure servers now D:)
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,great game one of my favourite campaigns but to many hackers on mulitiplayer
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,No other game comes close.....
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,good game just suck when you restore the game you back to lvl 1
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Funner than watching porno's with Ariana Grande.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,This ♥♥♥♥ is ♥♥♥♥ing trash.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,The game is a fun experiance in my oppinion.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Best call of duty campain &lt;3 co-op a little glitchy though
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Very nostagic! Brilliant game play! Definitely worth a play!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,This Game is the best Game what I play in my life
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Very good game but this is now ghost game :( Singleplayer 10/10 but now multyplayer 6/10 becouse a lot of random players who trying ♥♥♥♥ like 360 noscope or cheating :( If this game get competitive like csgo , more guns and other updates this game be awesome !!! Then this game i think play a lot of player :D But this is just dream XD"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Good game, but make sure to get it on sale. It's not as good as MW1, which is probably news to nobody. Not reviewing multiplayer, the single player campaign is about 6 hours long. The set pieces are great, some of the levels are very entertaining, and this game is visually fantastic. But, unlike MW1, the story is very stupid and, at times, feels very cheap and contrived.   As in, this game taught me that Russians are magical wizards and have the ability to transport entire armies across the world overnight, undetected by anybody. Or that security cameras only work when the bad guys face isn't directly in frame. Or that all terrorism in the world is caused by a single person, rather than complex economic, social, and political issues. Or that nuking your own country is the best way to stop a foreign invasion.   So, yeah. Enjoy the game for the levels and visuals and pretend the story doesn't exist. Because, that's apparently the same mindset the developers had when making this game."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Such a good game 100% would recommend, amazing to play on a Mac"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Probably my most favourite Call of Duty game - on par with World at War. I wish people still played it.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Best of the Best ))
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Ah, the very classic nostalgic feel when the battle fades to black and white, and you see that unused killstreak in your slot, then rage and curse profusely because it was a chopper gunner. Modern Wafare 2 launched with a blast, and the best thing about it was that it was ported to pc! Now you have an excuse to skip out on a split screen match, and let your opponent waste $20 just to get beaten with your advanced skill with an Intervention on Rust.  10/10, if you think otherwise, meet me on Rust, snipers only."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,This is the best of all Call Of Duty series  I would really like it if they can make a new COD like this one
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"good old times, Modern Warfare 2 is the best after Call of Duty 4."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,yews my favorit game :))
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"It's a really good game, plently of action. Funny enough 'Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 - Multiplayer' is even better. I'll give this an 8/10."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Amazing game love the warfare series ^_^
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"best single player in call of duty, pulling a knife out of your chest most realistic ♥♥♥♥ ive ever seen +210 multiplayer- got shot with a guy using duel wield shotguns using final stand and a riot shield +210 420/420 would rage again"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Highly recommend to anyone who likes first person shooters. Great single player storyline as well as black ops missions (can be played both alone or with friends). The multiplayer is where this game truly advances itself beyond other shooters, generally welcoming communities (the occasional jerk here or there like any online game), and massive replayability (Personally i've clocked over 450+ hours).   Presentation: 9/10 Graphics: 8/10 Sound: 8/10 Controls: 10/10 Replayability: 9/10"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Ive been playing this for one and a half year now, i LOVE it! i recommend it if you like FPS games!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,The best 
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Its a good game. The multiplayer is great  and campaign is also quite good
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,pwen all buy it k
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"It's a good follow up to the first Modern Warfare (speaking strictly of the single player campaign), however it is definitely way more hell bent on shoving little toys in your face than the former. Still, the gunplay is smooth and the story is fun, there however isn't quite as much shock and awe at the first one.  A good buy on sale."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I have had Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 now for a while. And while the game is fairly old, it has aged perfectly.  Modern Warfare in my opinion was one of Call Of Duty's best sidelines. Modern Warfare is right next to the Black Ops sideline, which is another one of my favorites.   Modern Warfare 2 is totally worth the money. I picked MW2 up for about $20 usd. And this game has supplied me with hours of entertainment, without becoming boring.   Now, before you buy the game let me tell you something. I DO NOT ADVISE YOU MAIN THIS GAME. And what I mean by that is that you should not play this game 24/7. The game is almost too old in the Call of Duty line. This game is perfect for when you are bored, and just feel like playing a semi-competitive FPS. That is how I play the game, and that is how I enjoy the game. The reason I am saying not to main this game is because I tried to main the game as soon as I bought it, this lasted about 5 hours. Then I was bored. But hell, who knows, you may play the game for about 2 hours and really like it, and main the game. But from my experience, it just didn't work that way.   But, none the less. This game really provided me with quality entertainment. And has earned a solid 8 on my grading scale.   Graphics - 7 (considering the game is old)  Multiplayer - 8  Story - 6  Missions - 8  Overall - 8"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,its very fun
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,It is sucha great game :D
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Great game. Played online with my friend. We had a blast playing it.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,i was stunned when my eyes laid eyes on this beautiful game that is mw2. im looking forward to getting modern warfare 3 and continuing the series. there needs to be more games like this not the futuristic stuff they are making now.i would love to see another modern warfare but its not gonna happen. im looking forward to the new games like this that call of duty will make in the future. if not there is always battlefield. i highly recomend this game to anyone who has played modern warfare or have not played this series yet. also you dont need a beefy computer to run on all high i run it on high 30 to 40 frames.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Good, though it's more than time to uplift my ban. Screw you VAC!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,-Plays first game. -Hacker gives you max level and all acheivements. -You ♥♥♥♥ talk a noob tuber. -He ddos's you and resets your stats.  *repeat*
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,9/9 ign ths gme yuo smke w33d n ♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥es uintell thy ♥♥♥
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Probably the most balanced and fun multiplayer experience of the last decade of FPS games.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,hey why is my cod mw2 multiplayer not working.its broken or something?is the server down?
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,still wondering why some people hate Call of Duty
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Best game in history :)
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"The BEST Call of Duty to date. Amazing high paced, crisp and smooth multiplayer with the best campaign of the series that leaves you wishing MW3 did a little differently. Multiplayer is pretty much dead now sadly. Everyone has bailed on it because of the talk of hackers. From my experience hackers are few and far between. Get yourself mw2, get on multiplayer and hop in TDM. BREATHE NEW LIFE INTO IT."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Great game, runs really well on my laptop.    10/10 would get noob-tubed again"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,*uses liberation for offline fun* *accidentally loads online* *gets life vac ban*  10/10
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Admit it. You ♥♥♥♥ed yourself when you found out you go to shoot up an airport.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Oh man, where do I begin? Modern Warfare 2 is the best in the Modern Warfare series, and one of the best Call of Duty games of all time. The campaign follows up the events of the first MW in an almost flawless fassion. Without spoiling too much, there is basically a terrorist attack the starts a massive war. The story is told incredibly well and has several rediculous twists. While I never really played much of the special ops or multiplayer, the memories I have of it are all good."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,FRICKIN AWESOME THERE IS THE OCCOSAIONAL HACKER BUT NOT AS MUCH AS IT IS PRESUMED TO BE!!!! GREAT FLIPP'IN GAME
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Call me biased, this is my favorite CoD ever. Aside from the ousted controller support this game still kicks ♥♥♥ when people are actually on... make sure you port forward!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Always Be Fav Game Ever!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"One of the best FPS games out there, better than even some of the sequels... buy it, play it, love it!!! ;)"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,great. best game cod has ever made
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,best game of Call of Duty  a reason to get a vac ban for him  to allways remeber how many i enjoyed  
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,The most amazing cod ever created! Won't stop playing even if it gets 20 years old.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This game learned me how to run and gun, 360 noscope, and reload in front of the enemy. A very nice game if you want to learn that for another first-person games.  Good Luck Have Fun :)"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Best Call of Duty i ever played -pros +Great storyline +Multiplayer +Good campane  +Good memes 
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2," Its old, but really cool. "
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Whenever i go into the multiplayer i just get a black screen! Plz Help
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Best FPS I ever played.Even if it's old school I still love this game ;)
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,this is my favrite game i love it thank you steam :)
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, Do You Have the DSM?
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Call of duty modern warfare 2 is probably the most call of duty game call of duty made.   Its so Call of duty that you can almost taste the 8 year olds banging your mother.   This is like the quintessential Call of duty  Save all your money and just buy this game instead of the other seven hundred thousand entries because this is as good as it gets.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,This is old but realy good story 
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"The best game ever made ever MW2 is a must buy, buy it or you shall be possesed by david vonderharr"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Even though this game was with old type of graphics and gameplay, I still enjoy it a lot!  The multiplayer is very well designed. I mostly got all the good guns at the start and I found that pretty well done! However, there was one thing I got slightly frustrated at. You have to be a certain level to get other gamemodes.  The campaign is well done. I love the second mission where you ride on one of those snow things. Loved how you can shoot while riding on it! (;  Special Ops is okay as well. I wish it had zombies but i still like special ops.  So overall, this game is fantastic and i strongly recommend you play this game or buy it! (:"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,ITs really good :P
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,I feel like Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 was the top of the Call of Duty series. It was everything it needed to be after CoD4
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Good Game!I like the multiplayer mode!One of the best shooter games!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Game is great on PC, highley recommend to any FPS fan!!!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,CoD 4 --&gt; CoD MW2 ------&gt; Others CoD Metacritic 86/100
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"The best Call of Duty out there. As of 2015 there's still 300+ people playing the multiplayer, which should say something about its quality."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,very fun game. to win mw3 go on musem level and kill makarov
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,it's the best cod game
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,*-*
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Realy good but no one plays anymore :(
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Greatest Call of Duty campaign I have ever played so far. I would definitely recommend it.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"dont know, i haven`t played it yet, and it looks like it`s going to take hours to load, what happend to the old days, when one`s you bought a game you take it home and play it instanly, without having to tell the world about it so you can play."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"So many years later and there still are matches going on in this game.  I originally started playing this game on the Playstation 3, but while that community died out and almost being unable to find a game to join, I decided to get this game dirt cheap on sale.  You might not find a lot of games in the rather obscure gamemodes, but if that's what you are looking for I wouldnt reccommend this game anyway. The fast phase of the game, the mechanics and basically maps do not give you the right feel when playing for example CTF or Demolition. There are other games out there that excel at this type of gameplay. But back to why i originally started playing it. Team-Deathmatch still is very playable, even to this date there arent many cheaters if at all in the lobbies I join. The fast phase of this game just makes me come back every time, Its that shooting someone feels so rewarding, even if you die 20 times after that, It doesnt matter, you'll respawn anyway.  While i dislike certain changes that there are, for example no (voice-)chat in lobbies, it doesn't influence gameplay.  This game is old and still there are people playing this, this and all of the above is the reason that I do recommend getting it if you do not have it already. Dont have the 20 euro for it? Wait for it to go on sale, I promise you its not a waste of money. You'll enjoy hopping on, playing a match or 2 and quitting again, But that like every 2 week for the rest of the time that this game is in your library.  Don't like multiplayer? Thats cool too! this game offers a great singleplayer gameplay with a continuation of the Call of Duty 4 storyline which also goes on till Call of Duty Modernwarfare 3. While the game doesnt offer much free exploration and such, I do like them because they give me the 'you are the star of the movie' kind of feel. That might not float your boat, but hey, I am reviewing this from my point of view.  The special ops is also a great addition to the game, while you can try to complete them by yourself, It makes it a lot easier when you try it together with someone else. There are a few acchievements to get here too, so when or if you have the time I'd highly suggest doing these too.  Overall is this game great, Especially now that it has aged so much, still playable in pretty much all aspects."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Great Game but too much hackers
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,this game will make you want to die
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,The BEST game ever!!!!!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,4/10 dead lobbies. mainly 6v6 tdm is about it
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"One of the greatest, if not the best CoD ever created, why can't the newer CoD be like this one? For real who wants to run on the walls and glide with a jetpack?!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,rllly gutentag
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,This is by far one of my most favorite CoD games!  - The multiplayer is actually quite amazing 'Ofc' With enough players to get you into que's for all the good gamemodes.  - The single players story is actually amazing 'Completed it on Xbox i have yet to do it on PC.'  - The same standard ranking system but it wont be CoD without it! :3  Note: The mutiplayer client is seperated from the Single player client. 'So if you review the game little side note it wont show your multiplayer hours.  Overral pretty damn Good shooter with an active multiplayer to get you playing for days.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,best of the Call of Dutys
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Still one of the best Call of Duty games in the franchise. Plays like a dream and I can always come back to play time and time again.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I think Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 made a great sequel to it's predecessor, CoD4. Great graphics, great game, and great multplayer maps/weapons and awesome singleplayer campaign also."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"crazy game, frustrating at times but amazing"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Ok. I will make this short. Campain: 7/10 (its short but i liked the story) Special ops: 9/10 (Very fun,you can do it with a friend.) Multiplayer: 9.5/10 (no more hackers!!!! This is my favourite Cod multiplayer)  This would be my third favourite cod afte Waw and Cod 2 because it has the best multiplayer. I hope this helps :D"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Likes: Graphics are incredible compared to console version, no high latency like on console version, and players are easier to get along with! Dislikes: Some days, my PTSD from being in Iraq causes my left hand to shake a bit, so controller support would be nice!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Easily my favorite Call of Duty Game of the series (that I've played at least) has a solid and controversial singleplayer. As for the multiplayer I'm pretty burnt out on it but that was only because i had so much fun playing it. But the best part of this game in my opinion is the Spec Ops since they're is such a large variety of mission types. I definately recommend this game.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Great game for all ages.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,THE GAME IS AWESOME!!! MUST GET IF YOU LOVE OLD GAMES!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Probably one of my most favorite games of all time. So many overpowered guns, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off 12 year olds and running with a sniper rifle, and also hackers lots and lots of hackers. But what fun would it be without hackers every call of duty has them, might as well just beat them and let them know they are inferior, or maybe their hacks just are... sorry i am rambling this was an amazing game until they released a new call of duty a couple of years ago... now it seems to just be the die hard fans that love it as much as I do. Play it/ Don't play it, I still love it!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Fun, fast paced, addictive gameplay with a very chill playerbase."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,One of the best FPS games I've played.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,campers noobs gl lmgs termal im love this game
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Besides a few minor glitches/bugs, it's honestly a must-have to the Call of Duty franchise! It's criminal NOT to have it!  Rated one of the best Call of Duty's to date..."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,This Game is easy to run
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,COD:MW2 - The favorite cod game of many. the game is just perfect.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I love the multiplayer in this game, and the campaign has some parts that I remember from this first time I played this game years ago. Coming back to it now brings back some nostalgia, I love this game"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"the only reason why Call of Duty made money and fame.  If you haven't played modern warfare, you haven't lived.  But the series is the only part of CoD that I recommend for newcomers- even though you cant play mp nowadays. the storyline is well worth some torrenting/downloading"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,all i have to say is this is the best call of duty ever made and I love it soo much because its all you need  I love illcames if you havent already bought this game what are you doing with your life
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,its aight
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Not many hackers actually and the best cod game I have ever played 100/10 better than black ops 3
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Still playing this game in 2016, One of the best Call of Dutys out. If you're a begginner to RPG Games, I highly reccomend buying this game and playing it."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I believe there is only one thing to be said about this game: Great. There, I've said it. Sure, it has a few flaws, but it's still the very best shooter I've ever tried.  I have more hours in this game than any other game, and I still play it today. Take the time to play this game, and find yourself entertained.  Also, a reboot of this game would have been great, so please, if you're reading this, sign the online petition to make that happen.  Best regards  Even."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I can't believe I have not written a review for this game. It's a little late but here it goes. Easily the best Call of Duty game by far. The story is amazingly well written and brought to action in a fun and exciting way. The music, let me just say Hans Zimmer is the fricken man, blows me away. Anyone able to write music that makes my heart pound and fill me with a sense of power is a god in my book. The characters are also amazing, giving you a sense of comradery as the story line develops. And the plot twists, did not see that coming! This game has it all, so if you want to get your monies worth and love first person shooters this is the game to play.  Sadly MW3 was a bit of a let down, but that shouldn't stop you from experiencing this epic tale. Rangers lead the way!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,REMEMBER NO RUSSIAN   The best game scene of all time
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Thid game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome!!! Singleplayer and Multiplayer nothing miss!!!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,possibly the last call of duty to sit at very positive  what else do you need to worry about
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Game plays very well on Windows 10 with all settings set to max.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,After 6 years and counting you wonder how and why are people still playing this game? I've been a big fan of FPS all my life and by far this one in my opinion is still the best. Over the Call of Duty series that have been released people still play good ol' Modern Warfare 2! Why? Some people say it's more natuaral looking and feel! I agree! So what are you waiting for? Let's Do This!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Must have
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Literal best cod game ever
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,that ♥♥♥♥ is not opening [Error code 51) fk my ♥♥♥ boy
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,great agme worth a buy
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,if we have a problem we settle it at rust 10/10
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,This is LAST GOOD Call of Duty or FIRST BAD. You're decide.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This is my favorite CoD in the series and the new ones are really a hit or miss for me. On PC, the game is infested with hackers but when you get in a game without them, it's a lot more enjoyable."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, Pros (+)  + Great Fun + Not many cheaters   Cons (-)  - Only Team Deathmatch &amp; Free For All ever get played - You can't change language after install   TLDR - Good Fun although PC community is nearly dead
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"  The recent disabling of VAC actually broke a lot of hacks for MW2, gg now cheaters arn't as rampent!       The Campaign    By far MW2 has one of the best campaigns of any Call of Duty.   Presentation wise the game has solid voice acting, graphics that have aged very well (lots of details in the enviornment, smooth animations, solid character models, etc.), and a superb soundtrack from Han Zimmer.  The story has many twists and turns, along with lots of characters that are well remembered by most CoD players.  Each level in the campaign is diffrent and there is never a dull moment, whether it's sneaking into an enemy base during a blizzard storm or escaping a favela, the campaign will leave you hooked for it's 5 - 8 hours (depending on what difficulty you play it on).    Spec Ops    This is a good mode to test your skills alone or with a friend, it has nice challenges that use campaign levels along with some unique maps just for this mode.    Multiplayer    It's very addictive, fast paced, and has lots of nice weapons, loadouts, and killstreaks to toy around with. It's maps are very good and most are classics. Hackers may show up once every 1 /50th of the time, but overall it doesn't ruin the game (at least for me). I'd also recommend looking at this guide for information on how to change your FOV to a reasonable level for PC (don't worry, you won't get banned as Infinity Ward has gone on record for saying it's ok to use an FOV changer  https://community.callofduty.com/message/205674719  ):        Changing your FoV (Field of view)&nbsp;"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Ok so i havent played alot of this game, but i had in on console some time ago so i do know what this is. sure, the game is good, but if you are new to the game, your screwd, like 90% of players are lv 70. if you are used to COD that wont be an issue but you know what i mean.   pros  - you can lay a few hundred hours on this game to get all the prestige levels, trust me that wiill take time.  - the costumiation is good (like it wouldnt excist in other CoD games?)  cons  - the story sucks  - CoD series will die at some point soon, since the games get less popular, keep that in mind before you buy this   if you use a antivirus program with f-secure technology, you may need to deactivate deepguard if multiplayer CoD wont start."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Best of the COD games.   Only con, doesn't support controller."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Damn, this game is still fun to play."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Play Spec Ops The line for a real military experience 
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,This game is  enjoyable and fun
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Well let me think of something....oh yeah Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 is one of the best CoD Games ever made! (better than Infinite Warfare) Oh and my top 5 CoD games: 1.CoD MW3 2.CoD MW2 3.CoD 2 4.CoD Ghosts 5.CoD 4 MW  Ok,let's start teh review: First and foremost is the single-player experience. As the anchor of the Call of Duty world, campaign mode is back, and it's intense. You'll instantly get a sense of just how far the improved engine has come when you're thrown into the bustling streets of Rio de Janeiro's favela, the ice-capped mountains of Kazakhstan, the dusty roads of Afghanistan, and other unexpected locales. On the visual side of things, Modern Warfare 2 is an obvious step up over Call of Duty 4 and World at War, with a stronger emphasis on complex terrain in the environments, weather effects, destructible objects, and the overall sense of action and chaos that comes with so many visual improvements. This is only complemented further by the increased attention to sound design, with the effects of many returning weapons being re-recorded,even more in-level chatter amongst your allies, and a truly captivating score by Hans Zimmer which builds based on specific in-game moments. Modern Warfare 2 feels like an action movie through and through, with the production values alone dating Infinity Ward's last game, Call of Duty 4, quite a bit.   ♥♥♥♥ING INTEL ♥♥♥♥♥ CLIFFHANGER LAST INTEL ♥♥♥♥♥ VERY HARD ♥♥♥♥♥ (sorry for that) SO YEAH!!!! I recommend this game! And I am doing a walkthrough! (YouTube)  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy_nQhRfBJtUavrUupet5Mg   Enjoy!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,The best Call of Duty ever!!!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Good game .Massive Gameplay.Servers Full of players(all pro`s) 11/10
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Great game. Would totally recommend this even as a 2016 game. It just has the quality of a 2016 game. Yeah the graphics and textures are iffy in some places but it had to be legendary back in its time.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,still the best Call of Duty
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Some say that the newer CoD games have ruined a decade of gaming; and they wouldn't be wrong either. But what's that? Peaking through the clouds in a radiant beam of light and glory, oh my God, it's Modern Warfare 2!  Modern Warfare 2 was my favorite CoD game and also was the one that really got me involved in the shooter genre. I loved this game and I still do! There were so many aspects that made this game right and actually enjoyable. The planets had alligned over Infinity Ward and they took that oppertunity.  The music (Composed by HANS ZIMMER) helped provide the tune and emotion of the scenery. No sounds felt out of place. The weapons all had their buffs and debuffs making some better adapted to certain situations than others. The story was rememberable and actually had me immersed in the experience that was Modern Warfare 2. The Task Force missions were things from action movie and kept doing something new each time. The Rangers started with what looked like actual combat scenarios in the middle east and transitioned over to defending the US from oncoming attacks in suburban areas and D.C. The Characters were likeable and all fit their postions nicely and the game left an amazing cliffhanger that was flopped by 2011's catastrophy: Modern Warfare 3.  This game had ties to the first that could be over looked without playing the prequel before this one, but not enough that the entire game makes no sense. The game had one of the most intense controversial moments that did nothing but increase interest in the game. The only three faults were 1. The constant hackers in the early days of the Multiplayer 2. Beating a dead horse with killing off characters again 3. The Favela controversy and the removal from the map rotation.  Possible one of the best CoDs ever and very easy to recommend."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Most fun I had with a Call of Duty game don't think any other Call of Duty serie game can beat this one. Used to spam this game 24/7 couple of years ago quick scopr mechanics on point
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Excellent game. I highly recommend it!

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Awesome game,  To all you CoD haters, this is not the exo-nonsense, but actualy some boots-on-the-ground gameplay!  So what is the game like? Noobtubes, UMPs, ACRs and quickscoping, nuf said, it is so broken that it is actualy realy awesome.  Enjoy it alone or with friends, have a great time :)"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Like the console version, exept a million times harder"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"1) Cre8 an intervention class  2) Sorry, you dont have Slight of Hand Pro  3) quit  4) mod yourself to master prestige  10/10 would hack again"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"The best game ever, LOVE IT!!!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Best CoD ever. This game got so much details and is still one ov the best online games out there! Should work on every PC!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"As good as I remember it, very much worth it when on sale."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Game was released in 2009 but even in 2016 is still worth buying. I totally recommend it.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Single Player - Short, but good.  Multiplayer - Best multiplayer on a Call of Duty game, destroyed by noob tubes and campers. Awesome maps though!  Spec Ops Mode (Coop) - It's not a zombie mode (obviously), but there's great fun to be had in this small missions.  Best Call of Duty to date, in my opinion.  (played on console, to be replayed on PC :) )"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,It's so ♥♥♥♥ing deep
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,This game is good but the only problem is that is has a lot of bugs. One is that your mouse will just stop and won't move even if you quit and relog.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,its a funny game and is good more then other call of duty
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"It's okay. The first will always be the best. Sorry, Dave."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This has been my favorite CoD for a very long time and i am always happy about the memories it brings back when i get on the game from time to time, though i do not get in it often, it is a much appriciated game."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Great story, great multiplayer guns but hacked lobbies are a problem"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"After all that time, Severus?   Always...."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,It is a good game with a good story and good multiplayer ;)
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,this is definety one of my most favrouit games ever i have played most Call of Dutys and this has some of the best multiplayer maps and has an awsome rankig and levelling system i definetly recomend COD MW2 to all who love first person shooters

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Love this game! had a few online games most actually had no cheaters but i had 1 bad lobby and someone tried to attack my netwok!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,its pretty good
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"A great Call of Duty game! I've played CoD on my PS4, this was the first CoD I played, and first I've played on the PC, and this has made me decide to get CoD on PC more often. The graphics are always at the top as expected of the PC. But overall this game has a great story and I think the Modern Warfare games has one of the best storylines of all Call of Duty games!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Its pretty awesome!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Literally the best game to 1v1 rust some scrublords in, and practice your 360 noscope and quickscoping skills.  I've only played around 300 hours in multiplayer, but it seems okay.  I'd give it a solid 5/7."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Hands down the best CoD game ive ever played. CoD4 is comparable but this one will always have my heart. Its a shame that Activision went full j3w on us. No longer a CoD player.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Great game for competitive play or just the advrage fps player!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,  :/
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"multiplayer is so unbalanced, its choas. 10/10"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I've played all of the CoD games on console and I've only liked eveything pre black ops 3.MW2 is among the best of the best not only in the series, but in the history of games.Call of Duty is known for being the standard for first person shooters, this installment in particular shows that it isn't the stadard for first person shooters, but that it is the game that most will aspire to be like.I primarly play Counter-Strike:GO and source so this isn't coming from some brain dead ♥♥♥-hole 13 year old who doesn't apperciate games.The Call of Duty franchise has gone down hill in recent installments, but this was the peak of the series.if you have the money.Do yourself a favor and witness it all come back to you."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Nice Game would definitely recommend to all, multiplayer is the best part."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,the best 10/10. Would mod again.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,this game is the reason why kids think that russia is a bad place
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"A good game, fun multiplayer but ♥♥♥♥ anti cheat system I got VAC-banned for no reason, I recommend this game however I don't recommend playing multiplayer because that's maybe the reason you'll get VAC"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,One of my favourite Cod games ever. The campaign storyline is amazing and the characters just pull you in. I have compleated the campaign probably 20 times. Weapons are all pretty fun to use. Have hundreds of hours on this game on console. Must recomend.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This is one of the best COD games ever! It had a great single player, spec ops, and multiplayer. In multiplayer you will run into some cheaters though. Also the more people buy and play this game the less of an issue the cheaters will be. I highly recommend this game to anyone that loves shooters."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"had fun, but the lack of dedicated servers for multiplayer was depressing"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,from all cod series this one is K
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Although Many complain about the game being unballanced and that kinda stuff, but when you learn how to take advantage of it, game can be very fair xD"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Old School Call of duty!! I love it! Buy it if you have 1000 hours of playing it!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,ChildHood game.. it is so fun and time consuming game (IN THE GOOD WAY) and i recoment it for U
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"The best and only CoD game which has a good story. Still worth buying.  Edit: Also, better multiplayer option with no hackers."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,  This might just be my favorite game of all time.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"MW2 is still fun, but I really, really, really miss lean.  Dedicated servers? Don't worry about that if you know where to look. The vanilla product will NOT have it though."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,i like it super mutch realy fun
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I absolutely love this game, yes, it's mindless, requires no skill and is totally unrealistic.  but I don't care cause I can jump on, bash a game out in 10 minutes and feel like MLG.   it's a shame the game is getting filled with more and more hackers and the game types are dying because of the host2host system it uses. it's going to completely die one day."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Dont take my lack of hours as me not having knowledge towards this game, this is by far the best call of duty to date. No bias towards other cods, ive played them all and without a doubt was this the most fun CoD made, it was made in 2009 for christ sake and its graphics and gameplay still blow me away with how much of a good job infinty ward has done creating this game, they need to stop making call of dutys like AW and ghosts and take from this game way more because Bo3 has taken me by storm and have stepped up with their game, infinty ward need to make more games like this and even the grounds between treyarch and infinity ward. Not a helpful review but a little statement on what really needs to happen in the years to come for call of duty. 10/10"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Great game, excellent multiplayer, i recommend it."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Modern Warfare trilogy has a character named Soap.  10/10 Best game ever     [But srsly I love this game]
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Great Game!!!!!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"MW2 = Piece of ♥♥♥♥ - Worst Game Ever Made! Why? 1.) OMA / n00btubes 2.) Commando 3.) Horrible Maps 4.) Rust 5.) Hacking 6.)

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,i love mw2 its my favorite cod and i suggest this
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Love it Gameplay,Story,Grapich The Call Of Duty ever XD"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Great game even though its old
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,A masterpice in the COD Series!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Great addition to the CoD series, storyline waaay too short though."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This has got to be one of the best CoD game out there. All of the new CoD games are in the future and has all that technology. Those game just doesnt feel like war, it feels like people with deadly nerf guns and jetpacks. This game takes place in the present and no stupid sliding rockets and floating cars. There is a HUGE bonus in the campaign. Not to spoil anything but you can drive snowmobiles, use ice-picks, use a turret on a car, and much more I didnt even reach yet in the campaign. The multiplayer is awesome but there isnt anybody search and destroy and other gamemodes but there is still alot of people on this game. If you reading this review before you buy the game and you are thinking about it, buy this game. Rating, 420/10 Turtles."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,i love this game  there are hackers but there is a nice community
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,The storyline in singleplayer is great. Ofcourse it all begins in Moder warfare 1. But I cannot review that game here.  Great game!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,...:)
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,ACTIVISION NEEDS TO MAKE THIS GAME WITH DEDICATED SERVERS! GET RID OF THIS CONSOLE CRAP!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Trickshooters ruined mw2... Dont's buy this game unless you want to troll
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Great Game! Tons of fun on co-operative missions and tough to earn all the stars, multiplayer replay value is neverending."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"The last really good CoD.  My opinion after more than 800 hours of multiplayer:  + a lot of weapons, each one got its pros and cons + interesting perks + very rewarding in long term (attachments, weapon skins, emblems, titles and prestige ranks) + good balancing + your success is based on your skill + a lot of maps + DLCs  9/10 One of the best multiplayer-experiences I ever had."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"it is a really fun game personally it is my favorite call of duty, but the one thing is not alot of peploe play it. So u are limited to playing certin gamemodes but i deffenillty recommed this game."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,made me love the COD serioes!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Truly, a Call of Duty Classic, you have everything you'll possibly need in a COD franchise, it's awesome, the AI needs a little bit of work. Definitely gonna play this game until I die.  I just hope that the next generation of gamers might appreciate this game more."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Blast to the past.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Very nice game.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"'No Russian' is the only fun mission in the entire game.  For that mission and that mission alone, I give Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 a score of 8.5 out of 10."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Good game with an even better community.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Best COD ever. Enough said.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"OLdish Call of Duty but I love it. Fun to play, interesting storyline. Worth the buy if your into shooters."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,I was sold by the front cover of the man walking through an explosion sandstorm mixture whilst nonchalantly avoiding the cameras gaze (original). Oh and it's the second one in it's series which is good because that means it's better then that first one.   The game...... meh.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Multiplayer reminds me of the good old days. Campaign is always awesome to play (EXCEPT FOR THE DAMN FAVELA MISSION)  8/10
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"One of the best Call of Duty games ever. It is an old game, but it is always entertaining to play."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"To be honest its a good game and all, especially the co-op mode but the online SUCKS because there are hardly anyone who play this game any more. :( Therefore my verdict is get MW3 its a ctrl-c and ctrl-v version of MV2 and there are actually people playing it online."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Absolutely amazing game, blew me away. The campaigne could be made in to a genuinely amazing movie, and the multiplayer is endlessly fun"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,One of the best games that I have played.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Great game. Though short. Looking forward to playing 3.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Excellent game, leaves off where the first one ended. Thrilling nonstop action throughout the entire game, The multiplayer is just as good as the single player."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Events of the game make it feel like a goofy James Bond or Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, which keeps the game from feeling boring. Gunplay is repetetive, and gets pretty tedious at sections of the game, but I would reccomend overall. 7.9/10"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"  Perfect game, its not infinite warfare. DONT pay $20 for this, get it on  https://adf  .ly/1c2xT1"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,this game might be old but holy ♥♥♥♥ is it fun. When was the last time you had fun playing a COD campaign?? THIS CAMPAIGN IS ♥♥♥♥ING AWESOME 9.99/10
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Surpassed Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare by a mile. Amazing gameplay, graphics, sound, ETC. I hope they released a sequel."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"The best game in the franchise, no doubt. Great campaing, missions, and Mp."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,You really wont be unhappy if you buy this game! This game is so fu**ing awesome!!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Enjoyed it alot back then.. Unfortunately there were too many cheaters..
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"why doesnt it support controllers?? :( to the guys saying why dont u play with a mouse its much better,,,,  I know but i have a laptop and i like to put it on my lap when i play not on a table, so i can play anywhere."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"  fun, balanced and good graphics"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Loved the story ♥
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,It's Gud
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,My all time favourite cod.this and cod 4 ofc
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,MW2 has more noob tubes and more noobs play MW2. More noob tubes for more noobs = 11/10 IGN
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"For me, this game is the best game that I have ever played! The story campaign i awesome, the spec. ops is awesome.... What about the multiplayer? The multiplayer is the best multiplayer in CoD history!  I really enjoyed this game and I hope that every player that buys this game will have a great time playing it :)  I highly recommend this game  10/10 "
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"definitely recommend. Brilliant game, good controls and for what it is the graphics arent that bad either only downside to it is there are alot of hacked/modded lobbys but yeah  "
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Hackers everywhere
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Just played the single player on Veteran to get some achievements. Played for the first time since a year after its release. The graphics still hold up. The story still holds up. The emotions are still there. Great game even if we did make fun of some of the choices the developers made.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"SP: The story is nothing special, in my opinion. It continues where it's predecessor left off in Call of Duty 4. Not to say that the story itself is bad, but it's nothing different than what you see in any other COD title. It is interesting enough to keep me engaged for as long as I'm willing to play, along with fun easter eggs and those sort of things. The characters, for the most part, are well thought out. Enough so that I became begrudgingly attached after playing beginning to end so many times. All in all, a solid title with a solid campaign.   MP: Obviously the highlight of most COD titles is the multiplayer, and it's no different for MW2. However, MW2's fifteen minutes of fame -- and support -- has long since gone by. Multiplayer, now, is largely dead. There's not many players online, and you do encounter the occasional hacker. Although I played a few games the other day without a hacker in sight. Even so, there 's approximately five game modes available, only two of which have enough players to run more than one game at a time. Still I have to give props to the PC MW2 crowd. Multiplayer has been dead for years on the console, but the PC version is still coughing up blood.   PC Port: The PC port is surprisingly good. The controls are spot on -- I had to configure mine a bit -- making it feel very natural and very easy to play on a PC. The same could not be said of Black Ops which had a terrible PC port (Up there with Dead Space). Graphics settings are robust enough, but not overwhelming - although it is quite bad at detecting optimal settings automatically. Handles everything just as well, if not better than, the consoles.   SP: 7/10 MP: 7/10 Overall: 8.5/10"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,This was the second game i played campaign on... First one was the best one: World at War... I love world war games.. but this game mode here is just fun to play Co-Op with friends or the sniper mission on normal Campaign!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,made it to 10th prestige in 4 days i feel good about my life now
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,America.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,COD? The conclusion of steam. Call of DLC
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Of all Modern Warfare franchise this is my favorite. Let's count:  1.Great story line + Cliffhanger Mission 2.Spec Ops 3.Throwing knife :P 4.Great fkin multiplayer (this should be 1st lol) 5.Killstreaks (NUKE *chuckles sovietly*) 6.Soap will die in MW3  7.Makarov 8.Maps  
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Depending on your charitability, the point where the franchise (should have) died.  In itself a healthy game and remarkably still enough people on the multiplayer to enjoy that.  But it was evidently NEVER patched of any of the rather glaring balance problems, even those that where outright bugs. One, quickscoping, was enshrined as an indespensible part of the game herafter for the ♥♥♥♥♥ that make up the remaining dedicated fanbase.  Still, the series hasn't exactly improved in any measurable way since. I might say your money is better spent on Black Ops. Under no circumstances should you spend money on any CoD title later than that. MW1 is still the peak of the series."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"single player doesnt start up and glitches my computer so bad to the point where i need to restart it.. but the multiplayer is good, VERY GOOD.  the single player could just be a problem with my computer, so PLEASE, if you want to buy this game, go right ahead!  The graphics are fine and usually, with almost any computer, never crash at all. But beware, there are hackers, not alot, but they are still there. There are tons of levels to go through and weapons to unlock along the way, like the ACR, or the AK47. etc..  PEOPLE STILL PLAY THIS GAME! Some people may think that old CoD games are dead and noone plays them, but they are VERY wrong! TDM, DOMINATION, FREE FOR ALL, HARDCORE TDM ARE FULL OF PLAYERS, SOMETIMES YOU INSTANTLY JOIN A GAME.  This game is a blast! Check it out!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Love a good campaign
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"1699+ Hrs and no VACations, and they still calling me Hacker!, 1 of the Best COD ever!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Good game way less hakers than PS3 or XBOX, it is worth the price even for natalgic reasons  Campaign 10/10 Multiplayer 7/10  Multiplayer is 7/10 because there are still hacker, but chances running into one is slim to none."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Many players have complained about hackers taking over this game but I've played for 5 hours and haven't noticed a single one. (Note: Multiplayer time is not saved on Steam). People said, 'Ah, 1 out of 10 matches have hackers or others said ah, about half of the matches have hackers.' Meanwhile here I am, I'm not even talking about matches, I'm saying FIVE HOURS of play time and NO hackers. It is possible that there could have been someone using an aimbot or something else that I did not realize but the difficulty has felt completely normal in every single match. I'm a low level due to just starting out and there are some other low levels scattered in the matches but mostly people lvl 70, yet nothing has stopped me from being in the top 3 many matches. I'm not saying this to boast, I'm saying this for the people who are skiddish about getting the game just like I used to be. I was scared of a bad experience due to hackers or tons of high level players. It's not the case here.  As far as servers go and playing with friends compared to Modern Warfare 1, it is the same as the console version of MW2. It auto selects your server based on ping and it has an 'Invite' button for partying up with your friends. It worked just fine for me and my friend. You pick your desired game mode and then the game auto-selects the server and map but players can 'vote to skip' the current map.  The graphics are slightly better than how I remember them on console. Menus, music, sound effects, hit boxes, your HUD, feels EXACTLY like it should. Player base has been anywhere from 400-1200 while I've been playing. I have not tried the single player campaign.  The only downside to this game is that it really could use more players. Team Deathmatch, Free-For-All, Domination, and some Hardcore modes are the most populated. Otherwise, in my opinion MW2 on PC is still just as great as I remember it being on console years ago. As of right now, ignore the negative reviews! As far as I've witnessed there have been 0 hackers!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,has an anti cheat that works .-.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,One Of The Best Series The Call of duty franchise Ever released
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"this has always been the best COD. If they had just supported this game rather than make more of them, they would have probably gotten all my money."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Pros:  -Good story. -Awesome guns for 2008. -Good voice actors. -Captain Price. -New characters were good. -Weapons feel great. -Brilliant OST. -Highly entertaining single-player; intense, memorable action. -Engaging cooperative missions. -Spec Ops is an awesome addition to the series. -Great graphics.   Cons: -A lot of hackers in the multiplayer mod. -A lot of bugs. -Extremely short and Anti-Climatic Single Player Campaign. -The airport level. -Skip the singleplayer."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Amazing story and multiplayer. Recommended if you liked the first Modern Warfare game.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,This game so impressive that everyone very glad to buy a next part ^^
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,I love this game is mgl af 8/8 m8 r8 g8 its my f8.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,The game isnt working when i click play i just get a constant black screen and im on mac but i have the system requiremtns
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Only the best Call of duty EVER! Campaign and multiplayer are great, except not a lot of people on multiplayer servers anymore."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,this is the best cod
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,      Score   9 / 10      Its MW2 what else can i say?
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This game is soooooo fun to play! If you like the other call of duty games,you would love this game!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,  Great FPS that can be played many why's also has not aged a bit and runs really good on my pc with ultra video settings
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is one of my favorite all time games. I enjoy the campaign, special ops, and multiplayer. I dislike nothing about this game and have been playing it since midnight release back in 2009 on the Xbox 360. This game will be considered as a classic and will always have the replayability that is has now. I can see myself coming back to this game in ten years to experience the noob tubes and try hard quickscopers and relive my experience from when I was 9 years old. I may be young, but this game is the Mario and Pokemon of my childhood. I grew up on first person shooters like Halo and Call of Duty and this game was my number one played FPS. This game on the PC has barely any hackers at the moment, it did a few months back, but they're gone now.   This game is in my top 5 favorite games of all time and will remain there for years."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Mountain Climbing sim 2069  best game 10/10 Would post on Dailymotion again
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,love seeing people name faze
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,the last great call of duty  doesnt mean the following games are bad  but theres a huge drop in quality after this one  play this one
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,its...
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,best cod game.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Really good game, recommend it! :D"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Is very GG, love it and brings back memories of enjoyment."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Love This Game! It's Is Easily One Of My Favorite Call Of Duty Games! And There's No Supply Drops! LOL!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Very fun game! Hackers everywhere tho ;-;
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Sadly this game has lost it´s glorius fun days it´s good to see people still play it but sadly the game is overuned by Russians who hack or only use rocket luncher or granade lunchers only. But co-op is still fun as hell worth getting to game just to play with friends. I have 577h put in to the game even if some what it does not say so on this review.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This game is crazy fun..... its annoying with the noob tubes everywhere but it also cause you to be more aware so i guess its a double edge sword there. All i have to say is that its good and if you like MW3 or MW1, i`m sure that you will like this game"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This game is great. Great single player, amazing multiplayer and a really good game."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Still cryin
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Modern Warfare Series is the best series of COD in my opinion and MW2 is the best, amazing graphics, great game setting, and just great overall. Story is still great and Special Ops mode is a great SP addon. Dem god deam nuclear Bombs :v . Rekt by hardscopers simulator 2009."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Definitely a fun campaign, very nostalgiac to reminisce on. Good call on the mission skip for 'No Russian', despite me personally enjoying every mission in the game, as it adds to the story and experience. Veteran difficulty provides a great deal of difficulty to the game, making every second you play serious and intense."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,make it so i can use my xb1 controller plz :)
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,This game dosn't get old for its age. It plays like a modern FPS and is really fun. I would recommend this to anyone who loves shooters.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,I really enjoyed shooting all the spies in the airport. It does sadden me though to learn that they are considering pulling the plug on the Call of Duty franchise and making this their last.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Story mode. Coop. Special Ops. All pretty fun.  MW2 Multiplayer is my favorite FPS multiplayer of all time. So many hours. So much death. So much fun. Nothing was too OP. Search and Destroy. Hardcore. So many amazing memories.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"The best game I have ever played, doesn't look like it was made in 2009, but more like 2014. Multiplayer is epic. "
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,1st mission: Shoot and kill everyone and chase down a evil guy 2nd mission: Be hitman and shoot and kill everyone 3rd mission: Shoot and kill everyone  4th mission: Shoot and run but kill everyone 5th mission: Shoot and kill Russians 6th mission: Shoot and kill everyone den launch a nuke Last mission: Shoot and kill everyone who is your friend and kill the villian that appears like the villian from 007 from Skyfall Where's the evil guy from the first mission? 10/10 would shoot and kill everybody again
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,11/10 Cheapest way to get a VAC ban. Would buy again.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Bought this game for the multiplayer, not regretting it except for an annoying kid voicechatting for the entire game bragging about his new rank"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Simply BEST GAME EVER ! Buy one ticket for nostalgia trip, you won't regret it."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Awesome game, I really love it. Everything about it i honestly like it. Music, Story Characters, Etc..   Not even bother thinking it's on my top 10 favorite games."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,I have pretty bad specs because I'm on a laptop but some how I'm actually able to run this at a solid frame rate so I would definitely recommend this for anyone
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Dated, but enjoyable. There is no server browser so good luck having prop hunt. Single player was quite good, and spec ops is fun, dont pay full price for this one anymore though."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Seems fun, need to put in a few more hours though"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"The game was released in 2009 and even now 7 years later I still absolutely love it.  This comes from a guy who plays BF4, CS:GO and Halo almost exclusively.  You should definitely buy it, because it's still one of the best games you'll ever play."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I'm playing this many years after it first came out and all the ruckus has died, plus I only cared about the SP experience. Thus in that sense, it was a pretty good game, I wouldn't say great, but quite fun and I can see how it would have developed a following. I foolishly wanted to run the campaign at Veteran difficulty at first... and then had a much more enjoyable time at a lower difficulty as it's a real pain to keep on reloading after dying. Rather just be Rambo. The campaign is not... deep per se, but still plenty of fun, mostly it reminded me of what if World in Conflict had an FPS version (another Russia invades the USA thing). I'd say, if you can get this for $10 it's worth it (about 8 hours of gameplay on single player) but much more and there's better games out there.   7.9/10"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,One of the first Call of Duty\'s I played and still love it. Just wish they\'re anti-cheat servers didn\'t work in private matches.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,this game is very fun 
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,still a good game worth buying for pc and not as many hacks as you think.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"The ambience and gameplay is all cool and epic, but the campaign levels are so long and boring. But still, it's still a very playful game and there is a lot of selection of guns."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Best COD ever 10/10 :v other COD sucks. In 2016 comunity is still alive, there are about 800 players (who plays every day), so you can play multiplayer :D."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Ummm so ive played and finished the game on the xbox 360 and got this it was FANTASTIC to play this game again multiplayer is just great 10/10...ps ive finished the campaign in 1 day so goood..... 
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Very nice game for both sp and mp
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Modern Warfare storyline is the BEST story of all the COD games. Play them
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"NoobTube Simulator 2Kwhatever  Friend(lvl9) of mine joined a game, rdm guy asked: 'Unlock all?' Hes now lvl 70 and everythin is unlocked...  9/11 would blow up again "
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Mission failed, we will get them next time."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,At least its better than star of wars oink oink iw sucks 
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Everything good
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"  I never liked any Modern Warfare for some reason, but i recently played the campaign and from being a Modern Warfare hater now MW2 is one of my favourite campaigns in any CoD, i know Cod 4, Mw2 and Mw3 have the same story but i guess il buy Mw1 and 3 to see the entire story  10/10"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Its fun... Just play it
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,does anyone know how to fix the multiplayer problem where when you go into multiplayer it just is a black screen for ever 
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Call of Trickshoters: Kick tools 2
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Honestly only CoD multiplayer I will ever play. They really mean it when they say Best Multiplayer Expereience.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Amazing game, has some bugs and glitches but its really good. Makes me remember the good old Cod days"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"good trip down memory lane buying this. only flaw is no controller support. PLEASE add controller support! everything else is great, active multiplayer, smooth frame rate, good gameplay"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"It has aged, but it's still a blast online and there are actually still a decent amount of people who play. Get it when it's 50% off. I bought this to hold myself over until Modern Warfare Remastered."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,That moment when you get shot from afar with a grenade launcher and have no way of countering it.  That moment when the enemy has snipers in a map you can't counter snipers in.  That moment when submachine guns are more versatile and all-purpose than assault rifles.  That moment when you die thanks to a camper who then proceeds to steal your care package including an AC-130.  That moment when you're an Insurgency player but still get a mediocre K/D/A thanks to all the imbalances and cheaters.  I don't care. This game is awesome. 9/12. Would Quickscope myself again with reflected Friendly Fire.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Really good game i would reccomend this game to starter and amature gamers
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,thanks for this amazing game! its so awesome that i play it all the time (0p0) 
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Memories, these feelings. This game will never die, will remain in our hearts for many years ^^"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Great game the times i had playing this game on xbox ps3 and pc they all are great.  This is a must have for anyone who enjoys the call of duty franchise
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This game is STILL alive! With around ~3,000 players at any time. I see many players complaining about meeting hackers everywhere, but i haven't met any hackers (so far) with 10 hours. The singleplayer is great aswell, even though it's mostly 'Shoot everything and win'. So give it a go! it's very addicting and fun. Out."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This game is amazing it is a shame that there are not more people playing this . pros/cons Pros : there are still people online but only in team deathmatch , the campaign is awseome, i have not seen any hackers. cons : like i said before there are only people playing tdm not search and destroy or ffa still it is a great game and i recommend it 9/10"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Game: Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare 2 Hours(Currently): 50 Rating: 6.5/10  My Thoughts: Welcome to my Second Game Review this year thus far. First I'd like to say, I'm only going to be reviewing games that I have close too Fourty - Fifty Hours within the game. This will be my final review until I began pouring more hours into several games. Let us begin, So this game seems to get alot of hate on PC. While I wouldn't say this game is the perfect Image of a Call of Duty PC Game; It definitely isn't awful. There are alot more flaws with the Game then Pros in my opinion, but none of these are very common which is Why I still give it an above Half Rating. Lets begin with some Pros that the game offers. First, This is the most Popular Call of Duty I can think about, You Ask your friend what is there most played Call of Duty; Modern Warfare 2 is most likely in there top three. It Has a very good reputation on console. The Campaign is amazing if you've never played it, The Ending is considered by some the best FPS Ending ever created. Although I differ to agree, but for sure It has one of the biggest Plot twists I've ever experienced. Just playing that and Completing the mission, Then seeing this Plot Twist through me for a spin. I Was in Awe! The Bonus mission at the end of the Campaign isn't the greatest in my opinion, Compared to Modern Warfare the Original; Though it is only a Bonus mission. The Spec Ops are 10/10 in My Opinion, it isn't Zombies from the Treyarch Series with Detailed Story and Developing Characters but it's very Action Packed. Imagine playing Multiple Missions from a 007 Game. That's how it feels everytime you load up with your friends. The Multiplayer is the best I've ever seen in a Call of Duty game. There is a very great balance in maps, Meaning there isn't more awful maps then Amazing remakable quality maps. The Guns aren't the best when coming to balanced but better then *Cough* AW *Cough* The Camos are the best in my opinion, and the Kill Streaks(NUKE NUKE NUKE) Is such a huge gamechanger. When they talk about adding to the newer games they should look at what Modern Warfare 2 accomplished. Something so simple like a Killstreak ending the game, Yet So Powerful and Effective. There are Flaws to the game though, Campaign: The Campaign has some visual glitches at time but are expected for the time period, and the Bonus mission glitches alot while loading and sometimes crashes the game for me which never happened on the console version. Spec Ops: While I still think Spec-Ops is so fantastic, The only real major flaw I can see that happens very often and is game breaking(Which they should fix) is that The FPS Drops frequently, I mean F R E Q U E N T L Y. Finally Multiplayer: While the Gameplay itself isn't that bad and has aged very well, There is one problem that really has ruined the experience, The hackers... While it's expected in every single game, It isn't too frequent as in Aimboting and GodMode in a older game like this, What is more present is Level Hacking. Now I know, 'It's just a level' But when your grinding and you enter a Boost lobby it's awful. You can't reset without going through alot of trouble to delete files, And you take the risk of being Vac-Banned(Yes you can still get Vacced, Happens Often) Which really can ruin the experience, I mean without the grind there isn't much to do within in the game besides grind for a nuke or two. What else is there after you unlocked everything? In Conclusion I very deeply love Modern Warfare 2 But because of the Frequent FPS Spikes, and Boosting Lobbies scattered all over the Multiplayer, I'm giving it a Rating of 6.5/10. Although I do recommend Purchasing if your a True fan of the Call of Duty Series. "
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,One of the best Activion Call of Duty series &lt;3  Go back to old times! &lt;3
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,I like destroying helicopters  and jets  and seeing in my corner tactical nuke. but like 10/10
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,This game is absolute awsome. It gives the player the cod feeling i want from the game.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Burger Town wasn't fully destroyed.  10/10
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"The Call of Duty Series had a fantastic start with its first game back in 2003.  It did something that no other really game had before, and the experience was intense and really fun. Many think it is the better game in the series, but that could be due to the fact it was the first game/experience of this kind. It was a huge success and the following games also sold really well.  A little later comes modern warfare, which pretty much had the same impact as the first call of duty game, riding on being new and a little different, and also having a good multiplayer.  But was the gameplay that different really, despite the graphical upgrade? I don't really think so. In fact, I think most Call of Duty games are pretty much exactly the same, with just graphical upgrades, plus minor new superficial game mechanics that in the end doesn't change the game that much.  If you consider that most of these games are pretty much the same you have to look at what makes a particular title more interesting than another.  That is, the campaign and the multiplayer.  Firstly, I don't play the multiplayer because it is not my thing. BUT, it could be worth it to mention that the multiplayer is still alive for this game, and thas has to count for something. Back in the day when it was new, it was hailed as the greatest online shooter there was.   For me, the call of Duty games are a 'casual' experience that gives you quite a ride. It is an experience that is truly great the first time that is. It is like a movie that you participate in (slightly). Each scene oozes of high production value and clever direction, great music, great action, and great voice acting. The graphics are not the highest but it is utilized so well that it still looks and feels great, and runs quite well on even older machines.  Modern warefare 2 has probably one of the better campaigns, and it probably will affect you even more if you are an American (I'm not). Later titles all have their cool stuff, but since the series doesn't really invent many new ideas there is only so much you can do before the games become quite repetitive and predictable.   Problems: I mean, these games have never been a challenge. They have never been hard to complete, and there is reason for that.  The problem is that these games are cinematic experiences that really want you to walk down a certain path and do exactly as the devs thought you should do, or the games quickly loses it charms. The first time you do a certain quick time event and/or chase it might be really cool. But if you make a 'mistake' and have to do it a few times, it truly sucks. Imagine watching every action scene in a movie 3-5 times in a row. You would hate it. And so the game can never be truly a challenge or it would just be truly frustrating. There are only so many times you are ok with insta-death because you went in the wrong direction.  See, If you want a good, complex shooter with lots of freedom you will not like any of the modern warfare games. Multiplayer might be your thing, but then you have to deal with hacking, stiff competition, and angry 12 years-olds. It is a great experience if you don't have to repeat anything. I also think these game are way too overpriced, especially the older titles, considering what you get from it. The campaigns are not exactly long in most games either.  But I do think that this is so far the best campaign, and even if other titles have had interesting ideas, they never really managed to nail it like this one. Get this game for a ride, (that might even disturb you a bit) for a heavily scripted roller coaster which will make your blood pump the first time. It is really good at that. But get it on a sale or you might feel cheated.  Cheers!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,this is one of those games i love       but hate the community
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Best Call Of Duty ever made. amazing story and gameplay. Just 10\10.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,110% Most fun I've ever had in any video game.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Pros -Action packed -Great Campaign -Excellent Multiplayer Cons -Sometimes can have technical issues but there are fixes everywhere  Overall 9/10
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This is a great 1st person shooter for anyone, its really adictive fun to learn but hard to master."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Love the game, I dont play it much but love it &lt;33"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I'm recommending this because it's a great game, sad to see such a great game starting to die. If this game had an active playerbase, the game would be perfect. Sure there's a thousand plus players online all day but really, you only play with 2 to 4 different lobbies of people. If you don't care about a slightly dead game and enjoy the CoD franchise, I highly recommend you buy this game."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"By far the best game of the series, unmatched by any other... Still playing in 2016 ^^"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"BEST GAME EVER. When i think back to the time i was playing this, little tears of happines come into my eyes because i am glad that i was able to play this game on a professional level when it was cool back in the days."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Good game Call af Duty : Modern Warfare 4 is a lot Better.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Variety to Counter Strike
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Hell Yeah!! What's better than guns? ... More Guns!!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Turns out it's pretty good.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,I really love this game on the xbox and the game it self. But i bought the game on the computer so i could play it online for free and becuase my friends have it too until i found out it i can't connect with people who play on windows(which is all my friends) and i was really bummed out. I know this is a old game but if they could fix it (i think they wont) please do   ====================================================================================    OVER ALL THE GAME IS GREAT   ====================================================================================
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,you already know
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"super good, but some hackers."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,This game is still 1 of the best FPS games available the multiplayer is not what it once was but can still be great fun. I had forgotten how entertaining the campaign was it was a joy to play through again. I played it first time round on the consoles as my friends were console players so didn’t try it on the pc the graphics look like a modern reboot if you never seen it maxed on pc before. Best £6 I ever spent
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,One of the best cods to date. Story is amazing
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I bought Modern warefare 1 and that was fun, ok, but Modern warfare 2? ita over the top :D personaly its alot better then MW1, mostly graphics wise, but otherwise, almost the same, but the spec-ops feature is nice :D"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"CoD: MW2 Single player is excellent - presumably as close as possible to being in a war movie that we're going to get with current technology. Compelling, fun, you'll forget to eat dinner.  CoD: MW2 Multiplayer is like banging your head against a brick wall. The best bit is when you stop. Totally stupid garbage, I can't believe everyone buys CoD for this ♥♥♥♥ and ignores the single-player element (which is much better). Players with the most kills are rewarded with control of weapons that allow them to massacre everyone else on the level. This has to be the only game series where this happens."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,What the hell kind of name is Soap?
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,very good game reasons 1.good graphics 2.smooth gameplay 3.playing with firends
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,THIS GAME IS #THEBOMB
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Almost killed as many Russians in this as in CS:GO, most of these didn't shoot back though. 10/10"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,4 player split-screen
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,This is my childrenhood game and i like it very much !
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,ITS are super suck game and i dond lovo why you smoking joint its seek
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Old but gold   Damnnn son are you ever played this game before ?   I'ts the one of the best COD's . And it's community and servers are still runing !  Well are you looking for some like ''Not-Sci-fi+No-futuristic+Real-life-weps'' thats the game that you looking for . 360 NoScope !!! buy this gaem
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,A great game overall. Easy to install and run. Good fun both singleplayer and multiplayer. Competitive and challenging. very satisfied i can find no fault with this game. 
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,BEST MODERN WARFARE EVER!!!! Aside from Those Annoying Noobs'Tubing Everywhere.. Its Still Awesome!!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"A good game,But many cheaters...."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Campaign is awesome buy it for the campaign and spec ops. The multiplayer though is full of hackers every server you connect to has a hacker in it. Im not joking around. Do not buy for the multiplayer you will regret it immediately. Also dont buy the DLC its way over priced for a 6 year old game.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I just recently bought MW2 on Steam, and it definitely is fun to go back to the old days of Modern Warfare. I beat the campaign (again) fairly quickly, and I did enjoy it. I also played Special Ops with a buddy, and I found that very fun as well. The only thing I didn't like was some aspects of the multiplayer. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not going to rant about the multiplayer being full of hackers. Sometimes it is, but that is the hacker's fault, not the game's. Althought it does affect the game's multiplayer, it is still quite fun to play it (not every game you join is full of hackers). The Special Ops is probably my favourite part of the game, and I still recommend it for any CoD fan, despite the issue of multiplayer."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I played this game with friends in school, got a great deal on the Steam download and it's everything I can remember and more. Seamless integration with Steam. I wish there were less cheaters, but for the most part, people are honorable and gaming is a s fun as I remembered."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"A great game that inherited MW1 glory. --Epic campaign. --Addictive multiplayer --Entertaining coop operations. CoD died after this masterpiece. --------------------------------------------------------- Price: 60€ (retail version) Price/quality: 6/10 altough the game is great, is pretty expensive."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Simply out, the best part of an absolutely amazing series of FPS! Second to none!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,This is a good game but it does have glitches. i have a vey bad glitch where everything does blue if anyone else has this problem please tell me how to fix it.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Amazing game play it all the time and still love it
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Awesome game, although I would highly recommend that anyone who wants to play on Steam via a laptop get a gaming mouse. It is difficult to shoot and switch weapons with a trackpad. I do quite enjoy the storyline and characters."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Hello, my name is XxX_420$7uDMufF1N69_XxX and I would like to welcome you to a simpler time called 2009 when all you had to do to settle the score was load up Rust and 1 v 1. Good times. Dont forget that Stopping Power is the only perk you ever need."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,best game ever made me walk again    EDIT 9/10 lobbies are hacked full of ♥♥♥♥♥ using wh and aimbot i will continue to be handicapped
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Singleplayer wise, MW2 is basically MW1 but with less coherent and more paranoid writing.  Which is actually pretty good this time."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Great game, Intervention is a must for no-scopers!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,fokin aewsome. If you like action video games with 'modern aspect' you ve came to the right place.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Great game, gameplay is amazing, weapons are cool, barracks too. But I won't recommend it nowdays. First of all, hackers, second - small group of people play it but still u got full matches. All tho stupid noob-tubers are all around the map making u rage, cuz the only thing that they do (if u don't know) is throwing gernades at ya. It's not fun, ok, just stop, its not funny. That's why i won't reccomend it, however it's a great game :)"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,I was wondering if this would support Ps4 controllers is yes press the (yes this was helpfull button )
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Cracking game and can run on a potato.   10/10
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,  good game well played
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,For me the best Call of Duty of all times.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Still a good shooter. But the Matchmaking and host system is ♥♥♥♥. +to many russian hackes.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,I love playing this for fun
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Yes! An overall fun game. This game still has ~500 active players online at any given moment, enough to get you into a lobby within 30 seconds. (Nov 2016)  Coming from CS:GO as a very competitive player, it was nice to have such a casual and nostalgic FPS game to play. Gameplay feels extremely smooth and responsive as long as your host is good. There are unfair parts about the game, but in my opinion: nothing gamebreakingly OP.  If you're willing to see past the hacker once in a few lobbies and would like some good ol' fun in a casual FPS: this is by far the best option."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Best COD in my opinion. Buy at sale :)
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,play it before you love it ;)
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Buy it..! But don't CAMP OR HACK
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"So Much Better When It Was Boots On The Ground , I Still Dream That They Will Remaster This After The Remaster Of COD 4 MW"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,One of my favorite games ever.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I absolutely love this game! I've played it on both PC and Xbox 360; I can say, without a doubt, probably thee best Modern Warfare out of the three in the series. Highly recommended for anyone on any system. Hell, someone's probably made it so you can play this on SNES, go for it!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,One of my favorite games EVER.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Best Nostalgica Game ... Sadly Activision doesnt give a flyiing f**k anymore feelsbadman.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,what i like   simplicity   competitive    fast pace   skill based and map lay out  what i dislike : ping is bad some times and ranking/finding players of your skill group should be improved and hitttt boxxxesssssss   cs go is amazing and always will be

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,I enjoyed it a lot
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I have to say of all the Call of Duty games (that I have played I am Missing hrs on Advanced warfare and Infinite warfare so take that in to mind ) I have to say CoD MW2 is my favorite it is showing its age BUT the Mechanics of the game to me are great he sounds of the weapons sound great so are the maps it has a loyal following it has developed some problems for some reason In Lobby chat is broken has been for some time and some times match making takes for ever. Another problem with the game is the occasional script kiddy that is hacking and well makes the game less enjoyable and does not have a voting system like Vintage CoD games U could vote some one out eg, Hacks.  Even with those negative points it's a good game to check out  "
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Still the best Call OF Duty to this day!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Been playing this since its release date back in 2009 and this game is still awesome. Wish Activision would released new games like this one.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,I get a little sad when I see this game it helped me survive middle school and now its all but dead. 10/10 thank you for being my escape.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This game is very good, I mean it's not the most beautiful game, but the gameplay is solid. Also, it is very fun to play the spec ops with friends. The multiplayer is kinda lacking, but only because most games are with cheaters at this point - not a problem with the game, just one with the community"

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,A blast from the past

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Execept for the hacking I would say this a fun game XD
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Very fun, campaign is interesting and fun, playing Spec Ops w/ a friend is where I find the most enjoyment in this game. Online is kinda cleaned up, not as many hackers or cheaters as you'd think. Only playable gametypes anymore are TDM, Mercenary TDM and FFA. 7/10"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,This game is very good everyone should buy it
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This game is one of the best i have ever played in my life, i wish that it gets a new patch for hackers and cheaters"

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,I cannot conplain about this the game is ok but the graphics are amazing.  The sound effect is also fine 
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Enjoyed this game a lot, and still do. Its a nice casual shooter game. Campaign is well made, multiplayer is fun and the grafic is still appealing. However i u should have an open nat in order to be able to play some multipalyer minigames."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Great game. Do recommend it, Especially for the campaign if you played COD4. The multiplayer is also loads of fun. Be carefully if you have it installed on a hard drive and then you back up the game and format the hard drive, it will delete all your spec ops and campaign for no reason."

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Inarguably the best COD game in the franchise!

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Cancer.. but not bad cancer..
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Best CoD I' ve ever played so far. Honestly the game is amazing but sometimes the kicking trickshotters and the hackers are just to annoying. And if your really interested in the game I hope you have loads of patience because there are lots of tubing ♥♥♥♥tards with one man army and shotguns, g18's, painkillers and much more. Overall ill give the game a 9/10."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"this game is good except for the kids thinking they are some trickshoting faze claners or something ,spinning around and noscoping then yelling Ouuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh ,,also watch out for shotgun skrubs"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"if wanna become a dank quick scoper, this is the game. I hit that 1080 ladder stall insta swap no scope collat first try i swear check my youtube :D Follow me on tumblr, myspace, add me on snapchat @ meme_lard420"

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Making a review just for Steam Awards challenge
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,  xD For Game
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Its real good.  Sounds pretty stupid, but its true. Despite all the other games in the franchise, I still fell that MW2 was the last GREAT cod. Even though mw3 was stupidly fun, and bo2 was very enjoyable, I still feel that Modern Warfare 2, even with all of its flaws(Looking at you noobtubers), is still the superior COD. And even though it was made in 2009, it still gives me a awesome experience. Would very much recommend."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This is, together with the first MW, the best game EVER made. Don't let my game time fool you, I played for 40 days on xbox live."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Probably the best COD singleplayer campaign of all time.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"The best COD game in the series, hands down."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,ten out of ten would buy over Infinte Warfare
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"One of the best games of all time. The story was solid. The multiplayer was good until they stopped caring about banning hackers. Special Ops was great for playing with buddies and challening too. This matched the standards of the original Call of Duty's. Activision need to make games like this again, not fancy space guns."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Probably the best CoD
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Such a good game, really doesn't get old. The campaign is still a blast to play, and the multiplay still has a decent amount of players. The peak of the modern COD series."

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,very nice shooter
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Best CoD game still... I just hope they remaster this one.  2 thumbs way up

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"this game keeps coming back as a key point in my gaming life, whether its the brutality of 'no russian' or the gripping story that reveals the darkest thoughts, this game set a bar that the rest of the series has never been able to compete with."

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"the single player is real goose, didn't play the multiplayer since it's just full of angry teenagers."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Fun game to play, Got lots of great memory's from this game while i stull was playing on the console."

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,What AN AMZING GAME OMG!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,home of noob tubers and mlg
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Great game, great mechanics. Multiplayer is great but there's less than 500 people at one time"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,'History is written by the victor. History is filled with liars.'
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I have very fond memories of this game, and i love playing it even though it is old. 10/10"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Too short to have a plot without a cliffhanger, too long to not be filled with epic moments. Hours of multiplayer fun, and people still play the damn game to this day. ♥♥♥♥ing co-op mode. How could I not recognize that this game is good? Add this as an expansion to MW Remastered so I can play this ♥♥♥♥ in Ultra-HD on my console too!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Its a really fun game with not half bad graphics for when it came out and the multiplayer is almost as good. The special ops mode is really fun, and it is best played if a freind. The campain is EXTREALY story rich, and its better if you play the game before this came, COD but the game catches you up if you dont have it. In all, its a good game!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Best multiplayer game I have ever played!!!  
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,awsome game. but the single player lags a bit. multiplayer runs smothe . there is very little lag on the multiplayer. 4.5 out of 5.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,  Nothing to say  But its awesome game
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Personal favourite of the franchise. Too bad there is only a few people still playing it.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,They don't write games like this any more.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"old school stuff  'heyy, dats pretty guud'"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Played for 7 years, could only nuke once in Rust.  Probably my biggest achievement in life.  10/10 would try again."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,one of best in cod series
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"  The number of times I redid the campaign on this game on my Xbox 360 when it came out is higher than the number of times I have taken a shot of vodka while playing CS:GO. This game is a masterpiece and shows how plot twists can really ♥♥♥♥ with your head in a video game campaign. The multiplayer all be it is a little annoying with having no buffs or nerfs of certain weapons (couch, cough, noobtubes) but regardless it is easy to let time simply slip away while playing"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Ah the memories, Me and my friends loved this game while we were growing up and we still play it today. This has got to be the game that defined Call of Duty for many of us and because of that, we got a game that stuck around for around 3 more years and was still awesome. Noobtube One-Man armies, Classic sniping, Perks, and NO EXO SUITS OR SUPPLY DROPS WHATSOEVER. Whatever Activison and Infinity Ward did with this game really paid off. This is a game that i would recommend to anybody. This game deserves a remaster, it really does. I really hope Activison and Infinity Ward does something like this game again so that we may play like the good old days again."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Its a good game but i whant new camos like gold
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,the best
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,best cod there will and ever be.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Modern Warfare 2 is a great game. The multiplayer is quite good and there are more players than I thought there was. You will probably run into the occasional hacker but I don't seem to run into any. The campaign is amazing. Probably one of the best. I would definitely suggest buying it.  The graphics are decent but don't expect much. The third game mode isn't very good but it's not terrible.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Will always be a fun game, sadly mostly people play other call of duty's now."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,My all-time favorite FPS. Probably the best Call of Duty ever made.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Best game on console and PC
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I you are considering purchasing this game, I assure you it will not dissapoint."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,One Of The Best Call Of Duty's.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Always loved the MW of COD games
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Really bestest game on call of duty franchise
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"GREAT game, but i would recommend playing to first Modern Warfare (Call of Duty Modern Warfare) 8/10"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,  best cod ever!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,  This badge is featured on your profile.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Classic.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,ONE OF THE BEST CALL OF DUTY GAMES EVER
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Very nice to come back to an amazing game after all the new cod's
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,I got a VAC fo doing nothing would buy it again 12/10
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,One of the best Call of Duty games. I can play it many times even though it is an old game.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"For some reason I am always placed in hacked lobbies, it sucks."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,the good ol' days...
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,In my opinion the second best call of duty game ever after COD 4. Amazing multiplayer but the campaign is kinda messed up. Spec ops are so fun and challenging at the same time! IW really needed to patch a few things and this game could have been the best first person shooter period.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"My graphics card is non-existant as I'm gaming (ikr lol) on an hp work laptop, but yet with my potato graphics card, this game looks crisp as day. 10/10 Would advise you buy this if you're not into the typical PC FPS (CS:GO)"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"One of my favourite Call Of Duty games, if not my favourite."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Best MLG GAME you could imagine. 8/8 i would r8 this g8me m8. would quickscope again.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Realy good game, old but still good. Good for sitting back and getting a 360 no scope on rust :)"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,like if you cried when ghost died
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Playing this game since it came out, never gets borring even when you play same maps over and over again.   Played it a lot, and will continue, just it would be good that VAC/BAN functions better, and that we are notified if somebody is banned (and we reported it). DLC packages should be cheaper, since game is rather old."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"PEOPLE ARE STILL PLAYING THE MULTIPLAYER! By far the best CoD to date. Have been playing in on xbox 360 since the day of release and then quit for awhile since not many people are playing it but the pc version still has plenty of people on it. You can always find a game for team death match very quickly and even search and destroy and others if you will wait. Best multi player on a first person shooter to date. The problem with the new ones is its way too complicated, this keeps it short, simple and fun. Amazing game"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,It's fun when you don't get spawnkilled on a rooftop outside the map.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,It's so great to play one of the old CODs again. Everything IW isn't.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Best Call of Duty multiplayer ever
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,it is a good game if you have alot of stratig skilles and if you dont its still alot of fun to play
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"best COD on earth, nothing like it."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Still the best of all COD games. The multiplayer was fun, better than in COD MW, and the story was a sequel to COD MW. The story is full of action and thrilling. This game is the example, how it can be made, but nowadays everything is made short and without passion..."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"My favourite Call of Duty. Multiplayer was super fun and playing the coop missions was also really enjoyable and intense. The story was well written in my opinion and it was emotional to play through. I always loved this game because I kept coming back to it. Unfortunately, most other games in the franchise are not as good as this which is disappointing."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,By far the best!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"A great FPS, a classic that I love, I can't complain about this game!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,it was fun on ps3 and its a whole lot better on pc
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Just play it, you won't be disappointed"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,the game is so good. i really hope they remaster it in the future. also hope that they dont include it as a deluxe edition to some shity futuristic cod.   ps the only problem is laaaaagggggg
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Played this a lot on xbox 360, played it for years infact. Always doing trickshots with FaZe and owning vJoshTheBeast. 10/10."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Seriously one of the best games I have played in a long time. Sure, the multiplayer is fun with all the hitmarkers and quickscopes but the singlplayer is one of the best singlplayer FPS experiences I have had in a long time. The game has some bugs but they are easy to overlook and nothing game breaking. I really recommend this game and it will be a game staying dowloaded in my library for a very long time."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,pretty good no hackers so far
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,love this game &lt;3
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"DIFUCLTY NOT BALANCE  YOLO PROTECT THE FILE TRANSFER UNDER 1000000 ENEMYS WITH GRANADE EVERYWHERE, LMAO"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Remember, no sh't cs go players."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,One of the best off all time
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,the only problem is the multiplayer because ther is not so many people active
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,‌
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Amazing Campaign, Amazing Multiplayer, graphics are amazing for its time LOVE IT!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I have about 400 hours of mw2 on my ps3. This, in my opinion, was the best CoD made. The campaign is terrefic. The soundtrack is just awesome. The multiplayer although may be a little bit broken with oma or death streaks is still way better than current CoD multiplayers."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Good game! Best CoD i've ever played. But there's a minor flaw. There are a ♥♥♥♥♥on of toxic kids/dudes etc and even more hackers. But the most hilarious ways they try to hide their hacks is entertaining and amazing :DDD 10/10 mlg G18MaStEr
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"The best game ever I played with (in the category). The story of the game (with the mw1,2) is very exciting, amazing. I dont understand why there is not a movie adoption yet from this game.  I only can recommend for all who like the fps."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"played most of my hours on console, easily the best call of duty followed by black ops"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,This game is good
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Akimbo shotguns for secondaries? F*** yeah!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,so this game is pretty gud m8 it trained my 360 noscoop skills so thanks infinity door &lt;3
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Remember when Call of Duty was good? Pepperidge Farm remembers. The one problem I had with this game is no controller support.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This was the first CoD game I've ever played. It seems I've started in a good place.  I didn't want to drop $80 on the newest CoD because I didn't know if I was going to like it, and I think jetpacks are stupid.  The story is actually not too bad, but super unrealistic: just like all CoD games.  After playing this, I went on to purchase MW1 and MW3. Needless to say, it's a fun game with hacker and 12 y/o free muliplayer."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,One of the best first person shooter maps ever made still unavailable on PC: FAVELA
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,BEST COD
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,This game very nice!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"In my opinion one of the best Call of Duty games, if not even the best one. Definetly a great game even in 2016"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,One of my top fav call of duty games gameplay and multiplayer it is so fun but don't forget guys on miltiplayer just mute those that rage in p v p :]
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,This game is really awesome! But too much campers :(
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Hope they make a remaster of this but lets hope it will just be the remaster and not a two game package so the boys at activison don't start charging 80$-100$
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I played for a little while and it was great! But after a few hours of playing the game stopped working, now everytime i try to oplen the game it sends me to a black unresponsive screen that i have to force quite everytime to get out of. Please fix this if you can. 5/10 rating."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Good old shooter and good old times when I was younger. Alot of time after school, trickshots for fun, that was nice.  Still hacker and loser noob tuber online but when you ♥♥♥♥ them, everything is fine. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  The game is fun, can makes you angry sometimes because of the camper/tuber kids, acting like there are good. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  I can recommend Modern Warfare 2 - buy it when its on sale. The NAT-Typ is a big problem, On Youtube there are alot of Videos: how to fix the NAT-Typ problem and how to put it on 'Open.'  7/8 out of 10 for a great game and for good old memories. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,  Best Call of Duty!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Steam ! My game is not working my game call of duty modern warfare 2 is not fix it in my camputer and i don t now what doing now and please repair this my game and fix my screen. Thank you very much !
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,danger close + m203 + one man army   great game very balanced would recommend to any of my peers.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This IS a good game. BUT BE WARNED -  Multiplayer is littered with hackers and cheaters.    There is a noticable number of players who are one or more of the following:    Invincible    Able to kick other players at will    Able to unlock max rank etc.    Using aim bots    Using wall hacks    Have unlimited knife/melee distance    Able to control public lobbies as if they were private ones    and various other things.   Infinity Ward/Activision don't care, they're busy squeezing cash out of fanboys' pockets. I've contacted Activision support multiple times, and they literally don't care at all. Considering they're still charging £20 for the game, I'd say that's disgusting...  It's a great shame, because it has a great single-player, great co-op, and the multiplayer IS good, but people have ruined it. All I can really do at this point is go to their Steam profiles and report a violation. Some people will rage in the text chat 'why must you hack? it's ruining the game' or similar, and 99% of the time the response is 'hahaha cry more' or 'shut up u ♥♥♥♥♥♥', as you'd expect. It's be GLORIOUS if these toxic people were VAC banned, but I doubt any of the higher-ups will do anything about it.  Not so much angry, as I am sad.  Edit: Steam displays my hours played in single player. I currently have 69 hours in multiplayer at time of edit.  Edit 2: The 'unhelpful' votes for this review are from fanboys who are infatuated with grenade launchers, trickshots, and probably some hackers themselves.  Which reminds me... the playerbase in MW2 is   outrageously   toxic. The number of times I've been called a f#ggot, had cancer wished upon, been told to kill myself, insulted for using a certain weapon or equipment... seriously, someone wished for my mother to die of explosive diarrhoea because I was using an MP5K. I don't get it."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,If you like hackers you'll love this game.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"IT's a good game, but hackers are crazy on this one. and then you geta VAC ban and you cant play it any more"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"What to say about Modern Warfare 2? Well, the fact that the multiplayer is practically dead, the only thing you can do is play the single-player, and spec-ops.  Now, you may be asking,  'Why is the multiplayer dead?'  The reason why it's dead, is because of the amount of hackers and children. Hackers in this game are the worst, even if you report a hacker, another five are going to take that persons place.   The game is NOT secure. I recommend you buy Modern Warefare 1, World at War, or any of the new COD titles. Such as Black Ops, and Black Ops 2, but NOT Ghosts. Ghosts is a terrible PC port, and is not worth it, but that is for another review. Modern Warfare 1 is the most secured, due to its dedicated servers, which keeps it alive, and 'clean' of hackers and cheaters.  Some examples of hackers in Modern Warfare 2, are people who use:    Wallhackers   Aimbots   Instant Level Ten Prestige, and ALL Unlocks   Hud-Hacking (Yes, it does exist)    Instant VAC Ban   The Instant VAC Ban is the WORST thing that can happen to you. I really do advise you to make private games, and play them with your friends, or find trustworthy people on Steam who host games in MW2 that are safe.  Please, please,  please  watch what servers/hosted matches you join. I really don't want innocent players to get banned.  I've heard that Search and Destroy games are  safe , but the player count is very little in most game types.   If you are still going to buy this game, and play the multiplayer, contact me. I will try my best to help find SAFE games for you, but the chances of finding these are very small.  I wish all of you people luck.  Overall, get it for the Spec-Ops, and the Singleplayer.  Edit: I no longer play MW2. The main reason why, is because I had a VERY close encounter with a hacked lobby. I'm no longer willing to risk my account.  Stay safe, and play safe...and watch for hackers...  -Cheers  "
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"As for singleplayer, it's good, but too short and lacks options.  As for multiplayer, all it is is a cancerous daycare center for 9 year olds."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"A great and excellent game but too many hackers, making it unplayable."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Most people remember this game as the last good Call Of Duty Game. The multiplayer is good, but you should probably buy this on console. The multiplayer is entirely plagued with hackers. The neglect from Infinity Ward and hacking has gotten so bad to the point where hackers can ruin your game, and since Steam cloud saves your data, it's impossible to fix in some cases. There's no word from Steam when the community asks for soloutions.  There are groups of legit players who play private matches, if you can find one, it's fun, but that's more of a tactic to avoid hackers for people who already have the game.  Some of the things hackers can do is change your resoloution, your minimap size (to the point where it takes up the whole screen.) These problems can be fixed by deleting you config files and verifying your cache. They can also corrupt your rank, and this can't be fixed, unless you get into another hacked lobby and they rank you up to 70.  This is a GOOD multiplayer game, but I'm going to thumb it down because of how prevelent hackers are, and people should know about. Unless you already have people to play with, I wouldn't buy it for PC."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This is going to be my first not recommended, but not because of the game because it's a great game. I had so many good memories of playing this game on Xbox 360 a couple years back, but that was not the experience I came back to. The servers are now all full of hackers and aimbotters and players that are invincible. I was so hoping to jump back in when a friend bought it and play a couple games with them and really show them how much fun a Call of Duty can be before all the added stuff from Black Ops onwards. Please do not purchase this game unless you do not plan to play multiplayer (which that is the only reason I purchased it). Fair warning to all."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2," -----EDIT-------  A lot of people have been accusing me of cheating in MW2 Multiplayer lately. This is entirely false, I did not cheat whatsoever. At the time I was playing there were (and probably still are) A LOT of hacked lobbies. What happened to me was I logged into a modded game. After being in it for few seconds it disconnected me from it with a message saying ' Bad host '. So I was like ok but then I noticed that literally all of the stats were unlocked (Titles, Emblems, Weapons and their attachemnts, etc.), it also boosted me from being a lvl 30 or something noob to a lvl 70, allowing me to enter prestige mode. I didn't deal with that, just a bit worried. I looked up on some forum, found that people encountered the same problem and that you need to contact support as soon as possible otherwise it'll ban you. I didn't know at the time how to deal with it so I went with the flow, hoping nothing will happen to my account. Then after a few weaks I recieved a ban, saying ' Cheat detected '. I then tried to contact any support but people on the forum stated it's too late because Steam Support won't listen to people who got VAC banned.  ALSO NOTE:  I remembered that around the initial VAC ban my account was hijacked and couldn't retrieve it after a year when a Steam Support finally realized the issue. I assume that the hijacker went downloading the possible external software for the game and used it on it in order to get me banned. I remember that guy, go check him up, his name is 'solutioNNN' and also has a VAC ban from MW2. I am not lying about this, no I am not making this up, this is my honest review.  -------------------  Singleplayer: Wonderful! Special Ops: Wonderful, even co-op is great! Multiplayer: THE WORST, EVERY TIME YOU GO TO LOBBY, YOU COULD ENTER A HACKED ONE, RESULTING IN UNLOCKING EVERY WEAPON, WEAPON ATTACHMENT, EMBLEM, TITLE, ETC. THIS WILL RESULT IN A UNFAIR VAC BAN. I do not recommend this game simply because of this mess. I recommend you to pirate this game just to experience the wonderful storyline. Oh, and if you happen to buy it and find that your items are all unlocked, I suggest you contacting the Steam Support before   getting a possible permanent ban ."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"IF You intend to play the campaign and special ops buy the game and have fun!  IF You only want to the multiplayer, You will be facing the most irritating cheater and also the worst community of all Call od Duty games. For multiplayer buy other games, including other COD's but surely not this one."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Game itself is great. Hackers have ruined multiplayer, though, and they just laugh and change their name and are back on. There's one in almost every match."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Was a lot of fun on xbox when it first came out, but PC is currently filled with way too many hackers."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"50,000 people used to play this.   Now it's a ghost game.."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,This game is great but to bad the multiplayer is full of hackers
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"used to be a great game, but hackers ruined it! You can t play it anymore. So sad!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"fallen prey to ever Cod game that ages. it's over run with hackers and players who arent there to enjoy the game, but rather to irritate you with over powered wepons, hacks, and rude jokes (involving your mother)"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,The 1939 Invasion of Poland was more balanced than this.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"If you actually want to play the game, steer far clear of this. The hackers have ruined it. The free for all spawns are broken, the aimbotters are plentiful, and if you are playing after 8:00 good luck finding any functioning match. If you're looking for a stupidly unbalanced, hacker infested pool of filth, this is the game for you."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,I joined a team deathmatch 6v6 game on literally the smallest map  everyone was in ghillie suits and using RPGs and gravity was set on low so everyone was a flying sniper rocketman  i came out 10th prestige with everything unlocked  ok its not what I expected for cod 6/10
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Spec Ops is great you can play it with your friends and have a lot of fun. Story line is good too.  But Multiplayer is s**t as to this moment I've played it for 2 hours and I already played with 3+ cheaters, I mean I saw the Kill Cam I know that you have hacks, I'm not saying that I'm great at this game but I see that you are tracking me through the walls.  So you CAN live without this game but it is still good, if you don't play multiplayer.  And I'm sorry CoD but for that kind of money you can get a much better game."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Game: Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Original Release Date: 12 Nov, 2009 Date of Review: 05 September, 2015 Update Febuary 2016: VAC has now been made useless, where VAC bans do not prevent people from playing.  The Good: - No overcomplications, no future/exo stuff. - Special Ops is kinda decent, and the campaign is alright. - Most guns are fairly balanced. - Config files not encrypted. - Fairly well optimised and decent graphics (by 2009/2010 standards) if you put them up to 'Extra'.  The Bad: - VAC REMOVED, cheaters roam free with no punishments. - Abandoned by developers, no bug fixes/patches. - P2P Networking, no dedicated servers (Unlike every previous CoD), therefore more hackers then any other CoD. - No included DLC, even though the game has been out since 2009, so small community split even futher. - The start of Infinity Ward hating PC gamers. - No mod support (Unlike every previous CoD). - No map editing support (Unlike every previous CoD). - Locked 65 FOV (Unlike every previous CoD). - No developer console access (Unlike every previous CoD). - Have to edit config files to customise commands like max FPS. - High cost, few sales. £37.99 for the game and all DLC, 6 years after release. - Literally a killstreak that ends the match."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"If you liked Call of Duty MW, then you will be disappointed. They completely ruined the awesome server system they had in the first MW and replaced it with this IWNet bs that doesn't let you choose the server you wanna join. Because of that it has become a paradise for cheaters, hackers and all sorts of rubbish. Combine that with the gameplay that has been more optimized for campers and snipers than ever before. Some of the perks and killstreaks you can acheive with camping are so overpowered that it ruins the whole experience. The single-players is just as good as the other COD games, but I bought it mostly for the multiplayer, so I would say it was a complete waste of money."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Nice game but too many hackers
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Worst multiplayer I've ever played.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Decent game totally ruined by uncontrolled hacking.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Now, Dont get me wrong. Modern Warfare 2 is a good game. But nowadays, you get nothing but hackers who get in lobbys on public and gives everyone a prestiege master hack or unlock all weapons. I would DEFFIENTLY play this game over Modern Warfare 3. And that's saying something. That Infinity Ward needs to stop making Call of Duty games in general. (Seriouisly, Ghosts is NOT worth it.)"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"there are enough players still around im mw2 but the game itself is an absolute copy and paste from call of duty 4. the fanbase is one of the worst i have ever seen and they will shout at you for being more skilled than them. it is not fun at all with all these horrible people playing this game. call of duty is very well known for the horrible players. the gameplay is absolutely nothing new and is getting extremely dull these days. you are trapped inside a tiny area with a few other idiots calling each other f@gs, and being attacked by the other team which are also calling you and their own teammates f@gs."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I loved this game on consoles and PC in the beginning, sadly the multiplayer is now infested with hackers no matter what lobby you go to, simply put. Its a waste of money. The community is now miniscule at best due to the staggering amount of cheaters. Do not buy,"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"The game WAS good, but i was kinda late with buying it (bought it yesterday). It was a lot better in the past, now you don't even have servers to join, just a matchfinding system. The graphic style is ugly (i'm not talking about the quality, i'm talking about the too much brown colour in the game). And, i don't like Infinity Ward's CoD, i'm more the Treyarch guy. Imma buy BO3 when it comes. As i said this game was better b4. Don't buy it now, cause you are 3 or 2 yrs late"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"10/10 would get modded by hackers and get 5 trojan viruses again   AVG detected 5 files within the Modern Warfare 2 files that were trojans.  will now uninstall this piece of ♥♥♥♥.  To be honest, MW2 isn't a bad game but the VACT (get it? VACT instead of fact) that there is no more VAC makes the game unsafe for literally anyone. Hackers are abundant and virus transfers are too. Stay away until VAC comes back."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Get the game only if you want to play singleplayer and/or spec ops. I DO NOT recommend playing multiplayer beacuse there are hackers who use improved cheats which can cause VAC bans to non-cheating players on the server.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,♥♥♥♥ game got banned for aimbotting? wtf is that ?
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Despite Infinity Ward selling DLC in all their games, microtransactions in their most recent game, almost never having to pay for server hosting, making more than most other game developers from tremendous sales... despite all of that, they don't spend the money on upkeeping their old games.  It's unbelievable that they drop support for a game once the next one is out, and the PC is always the last priority for them. There is still a ton of life in this game...or even COD4, but Infinity Ward doesn't even look twice at them anymore. Both games are plagued with a LOT of cheaters online. It's almost as if the game has become like a 'Thieve's Landing' type of place... a place where all cheaters get together because they know there's no law enforcement there. Cheaters cheating against other cheaters. It really is something that has to be seen to be believed."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,When i got this game it was great and cool. Over time though there has become a course of hackers and less population. I guess its time to let the good old days die...
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Just too many hackers in Online multiplayer.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Why the ♥♥♥♥ are all your games $60 forever.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This game is heavily over rated, the campaign is ridiculous, the spec ops is only enjoyable if you are teamed up with a friend, the multiplayer has no dedicated servers, over-powered killstreaks and guns and has no option to alter my FOV i rate modern warfare 2 2/10"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Probably one of my favourite Call of Duty Multiplayer games of all time. Now is unplayable because the main servers are shut down and to play you need to patch it (illegally) and play on cracked russian servers riddled with hackers and cheaters. Was good, now not. Stay away."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"It was a good game for casual play when it came out, now its broken since there is no VAC active for it. No competative multiplayer, people say that if you buy the DLCs you get locked to play with other people who have bougth them."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,was a descent game but now is a sack of ♥♥♥♥ that has a ton of hackers on like every server no fun sad face :(
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,OOHHH BABY ITS TRIIIPLEE GEEEEEETT NOOO SCOOOOOOPEEEEE NO GET A CAMERA MLG DORITOS MOUNTAIN DEW WEED xXx_♥♥♥♥♥'DESTROYER_xXx 
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Before I start I must explain that the reason I do not recommend this game is not because it is bad in any way, it is because its multiplayer is full of hackers/mods/spam and broken equipment (it also has no developer support).   The game is however very good, the single player has a gripping storyline that is full of action and great cinematic cut scenes. It includes a variety of wepons and settings so that each level is interesting, one level could take place in a desert and the next in a forest. There are intense moments and plot twists that really do get your emotions going, it's possibly one of my favourite story modes of all time. However it's slightly short and on veteran difficulty certain levels can be near impossible without touches of luck.  Single player also comes with 'spec ops' (which can be played co-operatively), spec ops adds another layer of difficulty to the story mode and alters story mode levels to suit a different challenge. It's divided up into a variety of categories including races so the diversity is enough to keep you playing when one type of mission is frustrating you. The frustration is worth it however as when difficult spec ops are completed you feel extremely satisfied.   Overall I would say it is a great game however its lack of developer support and its toxic hacking environment (online) mean it cannot be worth its price tag."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Short, though intensive SP campaing with over accurate enemies and useless team mates."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,No dedicated servers and hackers basically ruined this game...
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Hacked lobbies, script kiddies, noobtubers, commando knifers and an airspace filled with killstreaks. Every single multiplayer lobby is/has at least one of these, and it is bloody annoying.   As for the single player, 5 hours of linear nonesense (Campaign) and an okish co-op mode (Spec Ops) that both pit you against AI of your difficulty choice, with objectives on screen.  If you are looking to pick up an older Call of Duty, just get the first Modern Warfare. Less bs. More enjoyable."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It was the first CoD title leading the series into console ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t without dedicated servers, without a good community without anything. It had good potential but it's full of killstreaks and full of ♥♥♥♥. Sadly I have this game in my account. ♥♥♥♥!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This game would easily fall into my top ten of all time. I think this is THE BEST COD ever made, and probably well be made. single player is so damn good. But unfortuantly,the multiplayer is ruined with hackers. The fact that steam claims this game is Valve Anti-Cheat enabled makes me sad, there is no enforment of this wahtsoever. Its really too bad becuase this was one of the best games to play with friends, but until the multiplayer is cleaned up i would not say its worth $21.99"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"There is a reason why certain people tell other people 'Go play Call of Duty or something'. Now those people may not be the sharpest arrows in the quiver themselves, but they do have a point. In the male brain, there is a little person who leaves the cave only to kill stuff dead. I have one too, and often play videogames with him, but even he thought this was ridiculous. I like the phrase 'Ramirez! Teach me about the magic of friendship!', though."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Hackers... Hackers everywhere. Literally online you will join a game that is a hacked lobby.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,The beginning of the end for the Call of duty franchise
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,This was a great game I enjoyed it alot the only problem is the amount of hacked lobbies is just unbearable and now my minimap covers my hud so it makes the game unplayable Dont buy this game now it too late.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Well it was fun for a couple weeks, then i got deranked lost all of my unlocks, and my whole screen is a minimap, diddnt get my money's worth.."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I would rate this game highly but now the servers are full of hackers, this game has been out what 6 years now? and yet the community on it thats left gives gaming a bad name, so don't pick this up unless your a sad child who wants to hack a game with pretty much dead servers."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Pros:  - Nice Campaign - Good Graphics - Very well optimised - Decent first person shooter  Cons:  - The multiplayer is full of sweaty try hard - Rainbow name tags everywhere - Hackers - Everyone is Prestidge 10,Level 70 - Aids"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"The multiplayer portion is plagued by crappy controls, P2P servers, hyena hackers, and clan mobbers, but the single-player campaign is surprisingly deep. There are some truly jaw-dropping moments in the game, especially once you hit the halfway mark.  If you're looking for a decent last-gen multiplayer game, there are certainly better ones out there. Don't bother with MW2 unless you need a quick shooter fix and can find it for less than $20."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Almost every game you play online is a hacked lobby. It's stupid.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Multi player is alive..with 360/540 people 10/6/2016...of couse 1 out of 2 people are either still using 3rd party walling..but it was worth a shot checking if it was still alive..at lease the hackers keep it alive.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Ok this was a good game until it got hacked.I played 1 match and already recieved prestiege this is not cool fix this or else not funn 
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,The multiplayer is essentually dead. Few players and half are cheaters. Would not reccommend this to anyone for anything aside from the single player (Which is meh as it is)
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,graf ok. but i hate that all this 12 year olds gonna 'qickscope' and flame about so cald 'hard scope' why would you qickscope in war?
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Piece of trash game. Please never buy this, I don't know why I have it. If you have bought this like myself ♥♥♥♥ you and put your god damn head in a fire and hold it there till you die because you are a scum filled ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a human being you ♥♥♥♥."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"F*ck you!!!!!  I am so full of rage right now it's unreal. I have been a loyal fan of Call of Duty for a very long time even pre my PC days. I have racked up over 700 hours on COD Ghosts and nearly 200 hours on Black Ops 2. At the weekend I randonly recieved a notification mid game during my gameplay in Ghosts to say that I had been permanently banned from online multiplayer. No reason! Just a notice. I have never cheated on a game in my life, I collect games, I achievement hunt and I have a f*cking expensive PC, all of which pretty much cements me being a solid and dedicated gamer. I contacted Activiton and went on the community hum on Steam and all I am told is it's irreversable and they say I have breached one of their t&amp;c's for fair play. What the actual f*ck?? Why would I rack up nearly 1000 hours to then decide to cheat?! Are they F*cking stupid? I think this is absolutely disgusting and I am totally enraged by this because they have given me no explanation whatsoever other than a link to their policy agreement which is total BS. I am so enraged I am now refusing to buy anything from these c*nts ever again. How can someone or a company have the right to do this to a customer, especially when I am a loyal customer and have done nothing wrong at all. I gaurantee it's a group of ♥♥♥♥♥ on here that have complained about me in some way to force a ban on me. I have no VAC ban or nothing and never have had one. I hope those pr*cks at Activition read this and I hope half the f*cking gaming world does becuase this is not acceptable"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I've always enjoyed the single player aspect of these games. This one continues where the first Call of Duty left off. The graphics still are decent to this day (2016) and the music can get you in the mood as your shooting down soldiers. The only bad thing is this series rarely, if ever ges on sale. The price for what you get isn't worth it for single player coming in at little then five (5) hours. It's all preference. The mutlplayer component is there but filled with hackers. If you can get it on sale for 14.99 or less I say grab it. Otherwise, your not missing out on anything that has not been done in previous FPS."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Very dissapointed to spend 15 dollars (i think) and find out that the multiplayer is full of cheaters. At Least i can play the campaign but seriously super dissapointed.  I have 12 hours or something like that on the multiplayer. THIS IS THE CAMPAIGN Not the multiplayer. Thats why it says 0.5 hours on it clam down  If you are getting this for the multiplayer, Don't. Its a waste of money. Its full of cheaters and is pretty much dead"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,I hate this game...
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,This one was still OK....
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Almost every lobby is hacked and really stupid...
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,very bad game
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"If you like playing with Hackers, then i high recommend this game!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,got VACd for another person hacking.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Broken piece of garbage. No dedicated servers, player counter is broken, the in-game invite function doesn't even work properly, hackers everywhere, the community for this is dying out. I played for one hour before someone randomly hacked me to lvl 70 and unlocked every gun and attachment upon joining a match. Get this if you want to see a great example of a publisher who doesn't give a flying ♥♥♥♥ about PC."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Re-writing my review. As the COD series is on sale right now hopefully some of you will read this before buying MW2. Back when it first came out I gave it a positive review. Unfortuantely, over the years this game has become not only less and less fun, but now, hackerfield. Hackers everywhere. I recently re-installed this game about two months ago to play with some buddies of mine because they were playing. I literally played less than 3 mintues and then uninstalled. Simply because, #1. It was boring. and #2. HACKERS. Oh my gosh. Modded/hacked lobbies and tons of players with hacks, i.e. aimbots, etc. Please, please, please do not buy this game. Save your hard earned money."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I've owned every Call of Duty, except Ghosts, and Advanced Warfare. I have to say, this is where it all went to ♥♥♥♥. With the addition of lobbies only, and ♥♥♥♥ maps, and overall ♥♥♥♥ mechanics, this is the real lemon. This CoD is really what ruined SERIOUS competitive Call of Duty. I spit on the makers of this game.  Made for consoles, on pc, then ported for pc. Absolute ♥♥♥♥.  -100/10 Would never play again."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"i have played it until the end(4 hours gameplay) and still dont know about what happend,The story is just unineristing!Usualy i love the story of cod (playerd mw1,mw3,cod bo1/2,ghost) but in this story its hard to know why their doing it,I still dont know why markarov is a good character.then the final it was unlogical and unspectacular.Multiplayer:Only hackers more i dont need to say about it.Specialforces could be good but not with no players. Overall: I wont buy it again if I had a choice."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,i hate this game now because i can't play TDM or somthing like that
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This game is terrible. Game is poorly balanced, hackers are all over the place, and the hosting system is so awful I hated myself for playing it. "
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,i don't play this and contemplate why it's in my library
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Too many hackers and modded lobbies.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Omg where do I begin with this one. My steam has 3 ♥♥♥♥ing vac bans from modded lobby\'s. Never buying a cod on steam again now my profile makes me look like I hack.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Game is good, but unfortunately there are a lot of hackers and therefore receives less than me and the game is already very old and should have all the DLC to be free and not cost much more expensive! for which no one wants to allocate money!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Great game. Great multiplayer and campaign. The number of hackers in the multiplayer are like ...urgh.... well basically every third player is a hacker. Also one man army + noob tubes pretty ♥♥♥♥ing annoying but that's the game. If you're getting for multiplayer only don't get this. Even if you only want to play private matches they dont work :(
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Another sequel in the Call of Duty franchise. Not only is this game now very old it is also the bloody same as every other Call of Duty.Hey atleast they had half the decency and didnt reuse all of it right? The gunplay is unoriginal and the game offers nothing new. The graphics were even then when it came out outdated and poorly textured.I do not in any form recommend this game
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I have loved playing this game since I had it on the Xbox 360. However, this version is plagued with hackers, with no real method of action for taking them out (besides a long and laborious external reporting process).   I have never NOT recommended a game across any of my reviews, so this says a lot. Either Activision or Valve need to make this game's online actually accessible. Games without hackers are an extreme rarity, maybe around 5% of actual lobbies. Until then, this game gets a NO RECOMMENDO from me."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"For me this is the 2nd best Call of Duty game only to Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare. Sadly I do not recommend you purchase this in 2014. Graphically on my Windows 8.1 machine with GTX760 and 16GB memory the game has serious issues with jumping frames and gives the impression you're experiencing severe lag. (Can't find a fix anywhere!)  Moreover, as you'd probably guess with any Call of Duty game, it's been destroyed by kids who think they're hackers. Having some wannabe hacker remove your rank is not un-common. Fair matches are not impossible to find however you never know who is using a mod or what advantage they have given themselves.   Also be warned there are no leaderboards and only a few of the game modes have any activity. Search and Destroy is completely dead.   It's a shame each Call of Duty game is abandoned by the developers so soon after final release, especially considering how much the gaming community has given them.   (Played 4 hrs on multiplayer)"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This game was unfortunately the downfall of CoD. While it fixed many previous inbalances from the first modern warfare, it introduced many new overpowered abilities such as the commando perk and dual wielding shotguns. Not to mention how crazy devs went with killstreaks and even included the game ending tactical nuke. The game is still a bit of fun as it has very satisfying gunplay and can be very intense, but good luck playing some of the more tactical game modes that require teamwork over deathmatch. It also is very easy to get cheap kills that take no skill or for someone to cheaply kill you without really using any skill. The skill cap in general is very low as well seeing as it pretty much an arena shooter with slower and simpler movent, iron sights, and regenerating health.   On top of all of this, this game is a very bad pc port. It lacks basic features that previous pc CoD titles had such as dedicated servers that support up to 64 players. You can also apparently get vac banned for adding a fov slider, a feature that should have already been in the game in the first place  5/10"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"It's Call of Duty, the worst game series in the world."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Due mostly to it's lack of userbase and limited funtionality as a singleplayer game, I'd say to avoid not only Modern Warfare 2, but the Call of Duty franchise (post the third) as a whole."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,DONT BUY THIS HACKED PIECE OF ♥♥♥♥. 85% You will end up playing with subhumans. No wonder the sales were good when 1 out of 3 had to buy an new copy to cheat. Buy COD4 or World at War. At least there you wont be put into an position where you bend over and take it like a little b1tch.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Nope.  1 big Reason: Nope.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,get cancer activision i cant even play offline bc i changed my level now u bring back vac bans dumb ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Too many cheaters.... not enough means to stop it and I think the developers care little about it.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"'Games are nothing more than mere products! You examine popular market trends, churn out nearly-identical titles, and then you rake in the dough! Imitate our competitor's top sellers, that's the golden rule! Throw away your emotions and become a mindless machine, that's how you make games!' Activision CEO"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,the single player is short. like really short. its alright I supose but I wouldnt buy this game for single player. I'd save my money for something more expansive with a longer more satisfying ending and a better story that makes no real sense.  the multiplayer is ♥♥♥♥. conecting takes way to damn long. and the game is just plauged by hackers.  inshort could be so much better go buy battle field 1 instead.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"hate it. nat type strict. i portforward turn my router firewall on, it opens up then basically after my internet resets and it's back to strict. 6 days ago i played mw2 now it says Connecting to IWnet, that closed down ages ago. i cant even play mw2 at all now. thanks for the money steals ♥♥♥♥ you."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Ahh Modern Warfare 2, one of my favorite games of all time. but unfortunately it have become a hack fest.  I guess i can talk about the positives about this game before i tell you why i'm giving this a negative review. The things i love about this game, where do i even start. The first thing i can say that i love about this game are the killstreaks. The killstreaks like the nuke changed the whole game and it was so much fun getting the nuke. The other positives are: the guns (AKA intervention), Maps, Perks, campaign, spec ops and everything else. Now let's get into why i'm giving this a negative review.   (This review is only for the PC version, the Console version are still fine and you can get into a hack/modd free lobby easily)   if you are planning on buying this game right now, wait for a Sale. almost every game you join is filled with hackers using god mode and other cheats to ruin the experience for other people trying to have a fun, casual time. But sometimes you might join a lobby where there is no hackers or modders and when you find those type of lobbies the game become so much fun. but you realise that there is a small chance of returning to a good lobby again.  So that's the reason i'm giving this game (ON STEAM) a negative review. the game is almost unplayable with the amounts of hackers and modders ruining the game. So if you are planning on picking this game up on PC you should probably wait untill a sale happens. Or just get the game of Consoles becuse atleast there it's actually playable.  It's wierd giving this game a negative review since i love it so much. But since Infinity ward and activision won't do ♥♥♥♥ to stop the hackers or modders from ruining this game, i'm afriad this game is gonna be full of hackers and modders till the game eventually dies."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,CoD MW2 was the first shootergame i ever played. Back in the days i used to play it on my xBox 360 but some time ago I bought it for steam too.  positive Aspects: + The Singleplayer is absolutely       great
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,you cant find a game for ground war- community is full of modders and hackers.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"What to say about Modern Warfare 2? Well, the fact that the multiplayer is practically dead, the only thing you can do is play the single-player, and spec-ops.  Now, you may be asking, 'Why is the multiplayer dead?' The reason why it's dead, is because of the amount of hickers and children. Hickers in this game are the worst, even if you report a hicker, another five are going to take that persons place.   The game is NOT secure. I recommend you buy Modern Warfare 1, World at War, or any of the new COD titles. Such as Black Ops, and Black Ops 2, but NOT Ghosts. Ghosts is a terrible PC port, and is not worth it, but that is for another review. Modern Warfare 1 is the most secured, due to its dedicated servers, which keeps it alive, and 'clean' of hickers and cheaters.  Some examples of hickers in Modern Warfare 2, are people who use:  Wallhickers Aimbots Instant Level Ten Prestige, and ALL Unlocks Hud-Hicking (Yes, it does exist) Instant VAC Ban  The Instant VAC Ban is the WORST thing that can happen to you. I really do advise you to make private games, and play them with your friends, or find trustworthy people on Steam who host games in MW2 that are safe.  Please, please, please watch what servers/hosted matches you join. I really don't want innocent players to get banned.  I've heard that Search and Destroy games are safe, but the player count is very little in most game types.  If you are still going to buy this game, and play the multiplayer, contact me. I will try my best to help find SAFE games for you, but the chances of finding these are very small. I wish all of you people luck.  Overall, get it for the spec-ops, and the singleplayer.  Edit: I no longer play MW2. The main reason why, is because I had a VERY close encounter with a hicked lobby. I'm no longer willing to risk my account.  Stay safe, and play safe...and watch for hickers...  -Cheers  old cod better   0/10 (can I get it any lower??)"

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,I JUST GOT ♥♥♥♥ING HACKED SO I CANT PLAY THIS AMAZING GAME WITHOUT RAPID FIRE GRENADES GOD MODE AND INFINITE AMMO. I JUST ♥♥♥♥ING BOUGHT IT
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Ok so I have mixed feelings about this one...... I loved everything about CoD up until this game, and as far as the amazing single player experience I think that still stands, but the replayability for me has disappeared with MW2. The removal of dedicated servers, a plague of cheaters and what seems like a much younger (and less mature) demographic of player base, has soured my CoD multiplayer experience for now.   Let's hope it gets better with the upcoming Black Ops."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Too many Hackers...Ruin the game. One hacker gave me hacks, and that is one reason that I got banned from it because some guy gave me hacks while I was in game then reported me for using hacks which I've never used. Now I am VAC banned and can't post a letter so I can't get unvac."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"A hacker hacked my friends screen, and then i downloaded the hacked client he had just so i could try to remove it from my friends screen. And now i am banned from playing online just because i had a hacked client. So freaking stupid...."

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Poor maplayouts and Hackers Galore
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Too many hackers... Hackers killed this game.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"It was a great game in its time, but it has been ruined over the years by the rise of hackers appearing everywhere. I had the game for not even an hour, and I was hacked to level 70. I didnt want that at all, it takes the fun of the multiplayer away from me. Hacked lobbies are too common, and hackers will be found with access to all care packages(unlimited amounts of them), god mode, and unlimited ammo. Now, the story is still great dont get me wrong. But if you came here for the multiplayer I must warn you its not what it used to be. Buy only if you want the story."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Originally, i wrote a positive review. in hindsight, ive since deleted it.  Sure, MW2 is one of the best CoD games ever created, but the game was released in 2009. its now 2014, so the graphics and gameplay are seriously outdated, and there is now zero support from IW. yet Steam still charges the retail $89.99 for the game.  I PAID THAT UPON RELEASE!  there is zero justification to pay this much, especially considering the community has dwindled exponentially, and moved on to MW3, BOPS, Ghosts etc.  even on special at the moment for $49.99 there is still zero justification to pay so much for a game that is so old. honestly? you would be better off buying CoD4 and have the joy of private servers.  it makes me sad to not recommend this game, but with the blatant price gouging by both Steam and Activision, there really isnt a choice. i just hope this review will stop alot of people wasting their hard earned money that will offer a sub-par experience at best.  off the top of my head, i can think of a dozen games that are more worthy of your hard earned $$"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Call of Duty games tend to get a lot of hate. I got this one for free with a graphics card a while ago. After having it sit in my library for a few years, I figured I'd play through the single player campaign. This is a review of that.  This game is total garbage.  A nonsensical story held together by average shooting mechanics riddled down with tons of red goo on your screen.  Here's a plot summary:  Makarov, a Russian, is bad... apparently. So we go undercover, murder a lot of Russians, get killed, start a war, shoot more Russians, free some guy from jail... who fires an EMP at America, go back to finding the bad Russian guy, get betrayed by our commanding officer for no reason, murder tons of Americans and Russians, talk to Russian bad guy who helps us, and then kill a bunch more Americans, then have a stupid knife fight ending with the commanding officer who tells you that he did it basically 'so people enlist in the military'. Roll credits.  I feel like this should all be an elaborate ruse, but I'm pretty sure it's not. Sad.   "

The story is ok, I think it's good, but since the PC port is so bad i cant enjoy it. This game is nothing new though, its still the same game when it comes to multiplayer etc. just with a few new weapons and maps. I would not recomend this on PC, buy it on console since iCOD:MW2 runs much more smooth on them."

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"After the awesome first Modern Warfare the series just got ♥♥♥♥ed up. The beginning of that made MW2.  Story sucks compared to MW1. Where MW1 tried to create a 'authentic' atmosphere, MW2 is just unrealistic and ridiculous. It had its moment though. The gameplay is mostly ok; there is not much evolution, but with some interesting, but infrequent, levels which give you the choice of how to act. The SP is worth a try, even though it isn't as good as MW1.  What totally ♥♥♥♥s it up is the MP. MW1 was basically good, but had some issues. Instead of fixing those, Activision deceided to screw the game totally. Here are some reasons. If you are a fan of MW2, please do me a favour, and explain how you can enjoy the game with such problems.  -Way too small maps for the amount of players. Cluster♥♥♥♥ all day long. -Complemented with a stupid spawnsystem.  -Matchmaking, no dedicated servers. -Killstreaks. ♥♥♥♥ sake, I don't get it. How can people enjoy it, getting instantly ♥♥♥♥♥ 6 or 7 times in a row by a guy in a OP Apache in a game which is all about CQB? -Stupid perk system. Why the hell is there a perk which increases your bullet-damage?! -Zero weapon balance. G18, enough said. -Hitdetection and hitboxes. Watching killcames in this game makes me sick.  -And last but not least a totally immature community which is screaming 'ANAL' in voicechat almost the whole time.   I don't understand how this game can be so popular. I also don't understand why Activision decided to kill the franchise and create the CoD disease we have today. Get MW2 for the SP or the COOP. The only way you can have fun with the MP is in a private lobby with 3 of your friends, disabled killstreaks and some rules."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I removed the game from my steam account for all times. (my soul is clean) Singleplayer is too scripted and brainless. Multiplayer is good but thats not enough for a +review IF you want to play a good fps..buy a Wolfenstein, Medal of honor, Quake or DOOM."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"The single player doesn't even start without crashing, and I have been trying. A lot.  Even in safe mode, the game crashes instantly, and trying to tamper the compatibility settings prompts a 'Steam must be running' error. It's a half-assedly ported abandoned mess that is going to be lost in time and only pirates will be able to play it in the future."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,This game use to be good until the hackers came along which IW don't do diddly squat
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Really good game so realistic besides the fact it bans you for hacking
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"rubbish steam effort with no controller support as per usual , and they don't make it clear before purchase !!!!!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Meh. I've grown up.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I bought this game because years ago I loved it. It's a great shooter, a real classic of the genre. But, there is a really big problem. The PC version has very few people online and the system for joining games is a joke. Joining my second lobby, the game refused to load the game and it contiuned to do this. As a result I am refunding it.  WARNING TO DLC BUYERS: There are very few games with DLC online and it's a waste having it."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,THIS GAME IS ♥♥♥♥ING FULL OF NOOBS THAT PLAY NOOBTUBE AND ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ THIS IM ♥♥♥♥ING MAD THIS SUCKS I CANT PRACTISE MY FAZE CLAN VIDEO BECAUSE OF THOSE ♥♥♥♥ING NOOBTUBERS ♥♥♥♥ THIS ♥♥♥♥ IM ♥♥♥♥ING MAD OMG REMOVE THIS GAME EVERYONE HATES IT U GOT NO FRIENDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I have a permanent VAC ban on my record because of this game and its ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cheat detection. I unknowingly joined one of the many rampant hacked lobbies that the all of the hackers were creating, was instantly max level and had everything unlocked, and then was subsequently banned. Good job Valve...how bout you improve VAC and do something about the real hackers in these games?  Would be 9/10 bomb nuggets, but the hackers and faulty VAC detection make this stank, festering pile of elephant feces a 0/10."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Lacks a server browser, the main reason to buy a CoD game is the multiplayer, and unless you can coarse a group of friends to buy it, you likely won't have a good time. and it lacks the simple things that most shooters on PC have, like FOV sliders and it has an FPS cap.   The campaign is over the top crap, written by a man with a 5 minute attention span. It desperately tries to grab at some open links to the first Modern Warfare, and although the campaign is big on spectacle, it lacks everywhere else, minus Burger Town, which is sort of this games Volga River/D-Day landing.  A terrible port, it runs well but lacks so many features that any decent PC shooter released in 2009 should have. A terrible entry that started a general downward spiral for a great series. Buy Black Ops 1 or CoD: 4, or one of the original Infinity Ward games instead, those are much better.  Also, it gave me a VAC ban. ♥♥♥♥ off! Worst purchase I've made on my Steam account, at least Ride to Hell Retribution didn't stick me with a warning label."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Just don't do the mistake what i do because the game it's full of hackers and btw if u will place a hack noane will ban u because it's just full of those wores.It's a good game but full of hackers.This game need a bit more cheat protection because it's easy to place a hack invisible to vac u just can domnate de FFA.I just got a hacker in l00by and he dosen't care about vac bans he sayed: -I play this game whit hacks like 6 months and noane catch me. Now seriously if this game will get a better anti-cheat sisteam i will just play every day.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,the call of duds is bad lelelelelelel
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Game sucks ♥♥♥ don't play.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ DID YOU ENABLE VAC BAN NOW THERE IS NO SERVERS WTF
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Still no favela retured for the PC players and VAC was removed because so few players playing the game. In reality everyone is at liberation mods which allow custom servers (including favela)   I would love to rate up this piece of legend but it's not worth it anymore.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,was fun playing this game some years ago... now it's dead  TDM is kinda fun if you like playing it and if you find a game that isn't hacked and/or Domination  Search and Destroy is totally dead. You almost only find games with quickscope ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s kicking you if you play normal -.-  that one DLC I got has 2 maps I actually like but when activating the DLC you find less games (sometimes not even a single one)  do I recommend this game? nope will you buy it anyway because it's CoD? of course  the quickscoping kiddies got butthurt and disliked the review xD   the spec ops missions are kinda cool
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"As of now (I'm sure it's not as of now, now) the game is pretty much worthless to play. Hackers everywhere and it's just simply not worth the hassle to find a server without hackers. It was a great game back in the day but if you want a CoD either buy BOII or any of the more recent CoDs, whichever you prefer."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Not into the CoD franchise, 5 oppy guns in every game that everyone uses, quick scope ♥♥♥♥ like someone can do irl, and full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 8 years old. And yeah, i do play battlefield, 10 times over this ♥♥♥♥ community (not that there arent ♥♥♥♥♥♥s there..) "
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"If I had written this review 5 years ago, it would've been a Yes. Now, however, I do not recommend this game.  MW2 was great for a while. It had awesome sounds, awesome gameplay, awesome guns, sweet killstreaks, really it was just a great ♥♥♥♥ing game. Of course, people exploit ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like noobtubes and commando, and people have gotten too obsessed with sniping. I join a game to ♥♥♥♥ing sit in the back and hardscope like snipers do, not quickscope.  Now it's just hacked to ♥♥♥♥. The chances of actually finding a legitimate lobby are lower than the chances of you getting a life. R.I.P. in peace C.O.D."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Its really bad, you know its bad but you didn't know its *this* bad, its so awful. nothing about it makes sense, the story makes no sense, the writing makes no sense, the general gameplay makes no sense. the gameplay is bad even for a call of duty game, its the most obnoxious first person shooter I have ever played in my entire life.  Do you know that scene in dumb and dumber where they have the most annoying sound in the world? basically that but for like six hours."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Joins Team Deathmatch, gets in modded lobby, hackers put files in your MW2 directory, get VAC Ban on MW2, quit MW2, start playing CS:GO, Gets VAC Ban in CS:GO, Gets VAC Ban in CS:Source. ♥♥♥♥ this game."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,this game is... was a legend but now you cant play because on every single server there are cheaters or ♥♥♥♥♥♥ trickshotters lobbies and they kick you every time you are close to win.  
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,-Pros: CoD Parodies  -Cons: Spawnkill Simulator  10/420 'blaze her right in the camera' -iGN
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Dedicated servers ftw, play CoD:MW  This is a PC not a console."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Got VAC banned from the game for something I didn't do. I am not pleased. I owned that game for years.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,just another call of duty game! would not recomend playing online due to the fact its packed with hackers!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Personal rating: 5/10 Replayability: Low Budget: If it's on sale and you like the franchise, buy it.  Lenght: Half a day.   Modern Warfare 2 takes everything that was good about Modern Warfare 1 and Black Ops 1 and slowly starts decomposing it.   Modern Warfare 1 and Black Ops 1 are both interesting games because of the story, but this half-♥♥♥♥♥ attempt to continue a story that really just isn't interesting or captivating anymore, is just... Tiring.   The gameplay hasn't changed, the graphics might be a little better, but in a game like this, you don't really have time to stop and admire the scenery anyway.   The game is extremely linear and you're left with a constant feeling of frustration from not being allowed to make any decisions ever, and basically being treated like a side-character in someone else's story.   If you've ever played pen&amp;paper roleplaying games, this is how it feels to play with a game-master who loves his own NPC's more than he cares to provide a good game experience for his players.   That said, if you can get it very cheap, it's moderately entertaining."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I don't recommend this game unless you're looking for a short single player campaign and some ALONE coop fun. However the multiplayer and coop parts are totally broken, in MP almost every lobby seems to be hacked or modified in any way and playing this game over LAN is merely impossible due to the matchmaking system and the always online 'Feature' of the Multiplayer. Coop is also very complicated since you have to open ports on your router to sucessfully host a game, same goes for the Multiplayer part. Furthermore Activision and Infinity Ward don't give the slightest bit of support anymore and new hacks and other tools aren't recognized by VAC."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,0/10 - Cod speaks for itself.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"♥♥♥♥ game, uttrer ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, full of hackers. Don't waste your money. Please fix"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Got banned, not cool"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Got this game when I bought my new laptop in order to bring back good memories. However, as expected there's only small community of players left meaning that there are mainly only games in TDM,S&amp;D,HC-TDM &amp; FFA. In these games modes there are often hacked servers, low gravity, prestige, wall hacks amongst the other classics."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 in itself is not really a bad shooter. It can be quite fun at times, but it's shortcomings are plenty and I would advise you purchase CoD 4: Modern Warfare instead.  The biggest problem this game has is the way servers are found. It has a 'matchmaking' system that forces you to join servers you know nothing about, which are then hosted by a random player in the game. See the problem? Due to this, prepare for wonderful amounts of lag in every game, and in case a player forced to host the server leaves, you have to wait for 30-60 seconds for the server to migrate host to another random player(in the middle of the match). Add to this the fact that you can't pick which settings on a server you prefer, be ready for things like people jumping 50m up and server playing slow-mo or being forced to spin 360 degrees for every bullet you fire.  Another problem are the hackers. Playing this game with a wallhack seems to be a must for most players, as every enemy knows where you are at any moment and will shoot you through walls without you moving an inch, throw grenades at your face or kill you before they even come around the corner(that one might just be the wonderful lag I'm talking about).  Also, the game has a big issue with large monitors. Despite having resolution set to that of my monitor, when aiming down the sight the mouse will move for 5-10 pixels for each 1 pixel it moves when I move my mouse on my desktop, making precision aiming impossible and forcing close quarter combat. Maps themselves also force this, as most of them are made to suit close combat, and you can forget about any sort of tactics, as they are made in a way where you're forced to go down a 'corridor'(whether it's a street, tunnel, building) and the enemy can come only from in front of you, or behind you.  Game modes offered are plenty, but dead. As the game works on forced matchmaking system, you can choose between TDM, DM, Hardcore TDM and S&amp;D. TDM, however, usually contains 80% of the player base, which is around 500 players online normal times.  The game falls short of it predecessor in almost every aspect. Avoid my mistake, as now I'm angry I wasted 12.49€ on this instead of buying CoD4: MW as I originally planned."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"So this review is about a refund.  i bought this game a few months back and expected to get a fun delightful game and then i log on... people flying around rainbow camos, aimbot, rapid fire snipers, and ect. so i politley ask if i can have the full $20 back"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"it used to be fun but now everyone is just camping, using tubes and trickshotting. it is a fun game if non of those would happen all the time but eh.. w/e  single player is fun tho"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"only play the story, online is a joke"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,would jerk opff again
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This game uses VAC-bans, don't use levelhacks + consoles or you'll be sorry."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,dis is sht kil it coz it alawys gives me a blue screen dam mag i had 6 last time i attempted2play it wat a trash i deamnd refunds rn
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Singleplayer: Yeah its alright, wouldnt pay for it by itself. Multiplayer: Hackers everywhere and my favoruite game modes are all empty."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This game is complete ♥♥♥♥. Please don't buy it. In fact, don't buy any Call of Duty Franchise products, because they're all ♥♥♥♥. Instead switch over to a playable game like Dota 2 for example."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This is a fantastic game that's been ruined by scumbag ♥♥♥♥ing cheaters and mod users (like there's any difference between the 2 anyway). I've got a list of people who use cheats on here and already my 1TB Hard drive specified for that file is ♥♥♥♥ing full!  Don't get me wrong, THIS IS A LEGENDARY GAME! But it's been ruined by the Community."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"The game itself is good, but the foundation of players it has is horrible, and here is the primary reason: Too much hacking. Every game has a serious, offending hacker that ruins the fun for those who merely want to play the game. They either render themselves invinvible, make themselves capable of firing randomly and killing the entire other team, shoot another player through obviously solid objects such as mountains and hills, and they even warp the game mode (you may select Team Deathmatch, but they will alter it so that you are actually going into Domination or any other mode.) If you really want to play the game, then this is not the option. Just go with Xbox or PS."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This is one of those nostalgia ♥♥♥ games people can't get away from. This game brought in many new ideas to make Call of Duty what it is today and is considered to be the best in the franchise.  Yes. This game has an amazing soundtrack, maps, and guns, but unfortunately this game is horrifically unbalanced, ugly textures and graphics, full of hackers, and a terrible campaign.  It's one of those games where even though you hate it, you always go back to it eventually.  It's like a terrible drug where you know it's bad for you, but you want to keep using it.  I hate this game and I can't stop playing it! Help me!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥... aka bad game...
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,this game makes me moist~  too moist
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Every Time i try to play the multiplayer the game says steam could not conect.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"As much as I enjoyed this game, I can't recommend it.  There is still no custom lobby support / dedicated server browsing. There are cheaters in EVERY game and it seems that there is absolutely no anti-cheating mechanism in place, since they don't get VAC banned or even kicked. And they removed the absolute best map of any first person shooters (my favorite): favela.  I actually bought this on steam only to be able to play in that map in multiplayer again, and to my enormous disappointment found out they removed it YEARS ago because of some misplaced potentially religion-offending content and never patched it back.  Game has potential, still the most fun CoD, but the devs made very poor choices and basically showed the consumers their middle finger."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,it frezees on mac 
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Most populer hackers game!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I got hacked and lost my level 70 my embelms,titles and my class is a starter one again please help me "
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,I have no idea why I have this game. 2/10
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This is a good game, BUT, it does not work as there are many bugs and glitches, the game corrupts easily, and so is unable to be used. Love the game but hate the hackers, cheaters and corruptions. I do not recommend this game if you don't like hackers and wasting your money."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"So I bought the game, installed multiplayer, and started playing. The first game, I was in a hacked lobby. I was a little bit discouraged, but then, I joined another game, and GUESS WHAT? IT WAS HACKED. I was very frustrated and left the game. I noticed that I was level 70 thanks to hackers. Overall, if you want a modded lobby 99999999/10 games, by all means this game is for you!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"well it is 'playable' but I wouldn't recommend this actually.  Just played mw2. Here's what happened.  I invited my friend to play Team Deathmatch together. out of nowhere we're playing Domination. First we said, dafuq?! after that, 2/3 times 'Host ended game' In our team everyone was under level 20 and in enemy team everyone was almost max prestige. Sooooooooooo there's sum ting wong atm.  If you want to play this game, play it on console. Because this game is just a bad port. "
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,put 120+ hours into the multiplayer before it became littered with hackers and cheaters who just want to call you a ♥♥♥ :/  great game before iw stopped giving a ♥♥♥♥ about it
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,It gave me an endless blow job. It was not fun. It had braces.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This game is really bad, AI is either WAAAAY too easy or its got aimbot, multiplayer is filled with hackers or people who have over 1,000 hours on the game and noscope4lyfe.  Really I think call of duty is ruined, and this was the first ruined one."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,I have had this game for a while and only played just over 2 hours on it. After an upgrade to Windows 10 the game no longer functions; immmediately ceasing response upon launching. It is now unplayable and due to the time I've had it and the play time it will not be refunded. THANKS GABEN
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"By far the best COD game out htere, but that doesnt mean anything if you cant play the game though!   I've tried everything to find a game, several tips from pages and steam support is completely f'ed, so i do NOT recomend for anyone who actually wants to play the games they buy."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This is the game for you if you like shooting things with guns. Cause there are guns in it. And shooting. After I beat the storymode of the game I was invited to shoot more things in multiplayer. I guess I'm good at shooting things, but I really felt like I could've shot more things. With guns."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This game used to be a lot of fun!  TL:DR; If you play online, you will play against hackers, and not have fun.  Unless you play in a private lobby with friends, (which you can't level up and get new or fun gear in private lobbies) all of the online servers are filled with hackers. And even if those hackers get VAC banned, they can still play and cheat like they were never banned."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Best Way to avoid VAC ban is...... Delete this game Don't try to play multiplayer  Hacker are everywhere Also If you aren't using hack But If there was hacker or modder in lobby . Well that mean  Every Players in lobby can get VAC. Activision can banned you without reason Some how DON'T PLAY THIS SH*T Great Story Great Co-op Multiplayer is ♥♥♥♥ thing 0/10  Play Battlefield is the best way because EA has good anti-cheat system No random Ban  Better than Activision is Banned people without reason Random Ban [ Mostly People get random banned ] OH last thing I want to talk.The realistic is IN REAL LIFE DON'T SAID VIDEO GAMES ARE REALISTIC ! Hey Kids stop saying video games are realistic.  Because Your skinny body can't handle real gun[Even pistol]. Aimming weapon is harded than video game  NOW SHUT OFF YOU COMPUTER . GO OUTSIDE AND JOIN THE ♥♥♥♥♥ ARMY MARINE OR ANY ELSE ABOUT MILITARY ! IF YOU WANTED TO KNOW HOW TO REALISTIC YOU SH*TTY! 
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,For a game to not take serously and just be a ♥♥♥♥ being a noob its quite fun. If you are planning to take it serous i wouldn't recommend this game at this period of time do to the fact of the mass amount of nerds in the game makes it hard to begin as well as the high chance of getting a hacker in the lobby using aimbot or some crap like that. Other than that the killstreaks seem too extreme and that it is pretty easy to get spawned killed. So If you don't give a crap and your playing with a friend and you want to make a some 10 year old no life nerd rage bc you ruin their killstreak by noobtubing then this is the game for you.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Steam is unable to manage hackers on this game....so , just ♥♥♥♥ !"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,too old now and not very good when it was new.......Its not BF2 :(
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. MULTIPLAYER DOES NOT WORK. After a few hours spent in singleplayer, I decided to try the multiplayer. It worked fine at first but ever since that first session it will no longer boot. Have tried all 'fixes' discussed in the steam community but nothing fixes the issue. No updates ran on my computer. No drivers require updating. Reinstalled numerous times. The multiplayer program simply will not start. Crashes upon opening and requires a force quit to close every time.   Contacted Steam to request a refund. They refused as I had spent more than 2 hours in singleplayer, despite the other half of the game not even functioning.  DO NOT PURCHASE. MULTIPLAYER DOES NOT WORK. GAME IS NOT AS DESCRIBED."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"this was NOT the 'last good' COD. this game is horrible. bad gunplay, bad level design bad AI, bad story, bad characters, bad gameplay very quickly thrown together singleplayer without any effort put into it the 'best' thing about this game were the coop missions multiplayer suffers from the same problems as all the other cods after 4: unbalanced and generally horrible gunplay, terrible spawn system, insanely unfair items, bad leveling and unlocking system, bad matchmaking (no servers), unfair killstreaks, HP regeneration, etc. this game is bad, the fact that the sequels are even worse does not make it a better game."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,this game is trash
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,You can get VAC banned really easy from this game like me. Perma banned... I cri everytiem. ;_;
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Intesive but extremely short 'tunnel' FPS. That is the whole problem of CoD games. And from game to game it is still pretty the same. Again, again, again, again, again... It's not worth that money."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Great game, when it came out.... Don't buy it now though, hax are insane. Can't level up legit, Leaderboards are un-fair."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"There are two seperate components to this game.  The single player is fast paced and action packed, but extremely linear. A few stealth sections are present, and are OK by FPS standards. It fulfills its purpose of teachingthe player the controls well enough to play the multiplayer.  The multiplayer is fun in theory, but several problems get in the way in practice.  No dedictated servers ensure near constant momentary lag.   The player base is not very mature, and there is a good number of cheaters.  The unbalanced perk system permits EXTREMELY unfair advantage.  There is no votekick option.  Waiting time in the lobby is quite long as there are many players who purchased the hilariously overpriced DLC map packs that you most likely do not have. The only way to get around this is to pay 90USD for a title that already has a sequel, which has only served to lower the player population.   If you really like the gameplay style, get Black Ops for the console."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,just get a refund but csgo get another refund suicide
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Was a great game but like all old games the hackers have taken over and not fun anymore.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"yeah, id really like my money back. I can't find 1 server online that isnt hacked/modded and i can't even play. This game sucks and i wish i didnt spend my money. FIX THIS SOON"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,After 10 hour of playtime a hacker made me and a friend level 70 with all guns and attachments.  Was fun until then. Except for the dozen or so modded lobbies and 10 ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hosts before the hacker.  Don't buy this unless you enjoy playing with hackers.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,too many hackers
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,i don t have map in multiplayer for 1 month
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Why would you make a multi player game online with no match making ? What a waste. You can only play the spec ops missions with other people by inviting them, you can't just create a random match like EVERY OTHER GAME OUT THERE!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"mediocre game, I would only spend the money if it was on sale."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,It's so boring
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Get vac ban for nothing
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"not gonna recommend this because, its a dead multiplayer game and the story now isnt worth the imaginary bullets you'd be shooting."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Would I recommend this game back in 2009-10? Yes.  Would I recommend this game now? No.  The game was amazing back in it's day, but now it's just filled with low-life hackers, who ruin the game.  When you want to play some TDM, 25% of the time you will be placed in a hacked lobby and promoted to 10th prestige without your permission (Happened to me). Also because of all the hackers/ the game not being updated, the population of the game is about 500 people, resulting in you playing with the game people from day to day. Don't get it, the game is dead. Yet Activision still makes you pay £20 for a out-dated game."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I don't recommend buying this game now... developers just don't care about this game anymore, it has been 3.5 years since they edited Favela map (because of some painting frame which was offensive to Islamic religion that was hung above a toilet) and they couldn't take a minute to put it back into multiplayer maps rotation. They put it back in PS3 and XBOX, but not PC. I'm extremely disappointed."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Do not get. Everyone will be better than you even if your using the same gun and attachments. Its not worth getting when you die way way more than you kill.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"3/10 Sucks. Joined a lobby, I had no way of knowing that it was hacked until a mod menu popped up. It put me to lvl 70 and unlocked everything. This ruined the game. I have never experienced a hacker before today."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,wtf i whas using a mod but it say's i cheated wtf steam unban me now
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,since modern warfare 3 got released the servers will prolly be empty and I mean EMPTY. don't buy
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"No players, so you can't play this any more."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"It's just another COD, mainly designed around multiplayer which is pretty much dead by now. It's not impressive in any respect, just a shooter like so many others."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Dont remeber playing this... I will probably never play this game again.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,To many hackers
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,it was a meg alright game not one for fps
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"You'll get into a lobby with some kids who has mods and he'll get you to level 70 and unlock everything for you. (literally) Next thing you know you're VAC banned, and it's permanent. Fine, fine. Call them up and tell them it's a mistake. Get into a lobby like that again? VAC banned.  ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game, too many modders who ♥♥♥♥ you over. It's not like the servers aren't already drier than Britney Spears' ♥♥♥♥.  Waste of $20"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Only Team-Deathmatch mode works... !! Why other are not working? The game tries to connect but doesn't join any game!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Got VAC banned for joining a friends game. Can't ever play again.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,do not use it on mac when you download it goes to a black screen
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,i bought the game not from steam but from walmart it said it cant run on my 64 bit but thats what i own its slow and lags 
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"-No lifes COD -Gets into Modded Lobby -Gets Vac banned  -Comes back 1,884 days later to write review  - 1/10 would not play again"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,its multiplayer lets hackers in and i dont like some of its maps
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,I love the game and played endless hours on my XBOX 360 and then on PC... until I got VAC banned for a modder leveling everyone up without choice in a TDM lobby to get the banned. Otherwise i'd give it 10/10.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"If you're this late into buying this game, you should've bought it while it was still gold; too many hackers in games, just spinbotting with snipers. This game is still great and all, but tbh, it's just dead now and not worth your money. Just save for a sale on this game or buy another game. Buy Zero G Arena maybe."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"just bouight this game last week for $20.00 . Story mode is awesome and whatnot but if you are looking for online competition, this game is the worst. No one is really online and when you find a server, it is supper laggy or a host is switching like every 3 minutes"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Cheater war....game not supported anymore... RIP COD!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,This would still be a awsome game if it wasn't for the wall hacks that are still going on here
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I had tons of fun with this game at one point, as you can probably tell by my hours played in Multiplayer. There's no denying it's quite a fun game, well, was a fun game.   In it's current state (referring to the online) it isn't worth buying. There aren't as many people playing anymore, and you'll probably get caught up in the same two or three lobbies, half of which are modded.   By the off chance you land yourself in a fresh lobby with no hackers, then you'll still have to deal with an FOV locked at 65, which for many people is just absurd. (You can find a third party launcher than changes the FOV without getting banned by IW, that's what I used for a while).   At one point this game was teeming with competative, fair players. It used to be one of the only COD games, besides CoD4, with a decent community. Unfortunately, the game now houses boatloads of hackers, modded lobbies, and little incentive to keep playing.  Anyway, great game if you have the patience to ignore these major flaws, but I cannot recommend it anymore in it's current state."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I am upset with this game because of the matchmaking system. It automatically searches for players in your area, and since there was not many i couldn't hardly get into a game, so me and my 2 other friends would just play private matches. However you cannot level up doing this and 1 of my friends was the highest level so he had all the guns me and my other friend didn't have. This felt unfair since we couldn't level up, therefore we decided to download some hacks just so we could actually level ourselves up quickly. We didn't hack agaist other players so we didn't ruin anyone else's experience, we just wanted to be able to enjoy the game that we payed for. However, we ended up getting VAC banned for this. I do not believe this was a fair ban but whatever. Now I can no longer even play the game. What garbage."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"If I had a Billion, yes a billion dollars and paid a dollar everytime I got noobtubed in this game I would have no money, because I broke my PC so many times of raging and bought a new one"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Nostaligia is nice, but playing this in 2015 is worse than it was in 2010. Apparently the people that still play this have been using those 5 years to learn how to be the best camper that has ever camped."

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"There's not a lot of servers running, I can only find one player and then they leave :("
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Having never played MW2 before on any system, Time before realising Multiplayer is highly unbalanced - 2 Hours. Time before noticing trickshotting botters - 1 Hour Time before uninstalling - 2 Hours Time raged - 1 Hour. -Uninstalled and set to refund.  In all seriousness this game lacks an Anti Cheat now, the multiplayer lacks an resemblance of balance and 90% of people who play this now are doing so because of nostalgia. The singleplayer campaign lacks depth and comes off decidedly 'Meh' it's neither good nor awful. Normally I would give a game at least a few more hours before reviewing, but the obvious flaws in this one presented themselves early and I do not see them going away."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Guys how can i find and play 3rd person mod , servers when i try the option 'FIND GAME', there is no server in 3rd person mod. help plzz ;)"

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,One of the best games of all time. And best COD of all time.  ---------------------------------------------------------------  BUT the game is 20 ♥♥♥♥ing dollars when it came out in 2009 (7 years ago as of 2016). You can go to Gamestop and get this game for like 5 dollars. This is such a rip-off. Same with Black Ops 1-2... ITS SO MUCH FOR THE AGE!  Get the game on sale.. if not.. god bless

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I do not like games with such repetitive gameplay. Here, the objective is ‘run, shoot, reload’, nothing left to strategy, imagination. Stealth missions are nearly non-existent. If you are the fan of the franchise, you defintely should buy it, but other people would do better without playing this game."

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Singleplayer is fine: 8/10  Multiplayer: 4/10 This is the greatest and best cod in the history but there are problems inside the community, that can't be solved like Tubers, Rpgs, Thumpers, G18 Akimbo, and all this noob stuff that kids use to play better, I've played one match where a guy, called ATUq, did 3-34 and those kills were directed to me by Grenade launcher. When they wins, because they will always win, because you are doing 23-0 and they tube you accross the map, they write things kinda 'Ez, you noobs' or 'Frank da TANK rekts you'. I've played this on competitive side, CTS and networks like this on console so many years ago, and now I think I'm leaving this game because of this rage problems that simply win agains the whole game. This game is DEAD, or better, it is left to die.  In January 2016, I don't recommend this anymore."

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Battlefield MasterRace
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,The multi-player is the worst adventure I've ever seen. Could I get my money back now?
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I bought two copies of the game (PC and MAC) to play together on lan. The problem is that coop doesnt work on combination PC - MAC and when I play campaign it stucks on Mission 8 (Mac) making it impossible to complete. Terrible MAC support, so I advise other people not to purchase the game."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This game is the reflection of the human condition. We all know hoe it is, and even though the are many things that could be easily improved for the benefit of the most, the few who can don't bother to do a single step. All they care is money. Exactly as mankind.  Would be difficult to change the teamcolors in order to help daltonics? Would be difficult to fix the server instability? Would be difficult to improve the chat menu? Would be difficult to allow mods and add ons since most of kids cheat anyway?  The fact that this game still costs 20 buck is the proof that money is all what they seek. The only reason worth playing this game are the maps, which are quite good, and the men is simple, but there are far better and cheaper games out there."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.' Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,  This game is cancer on the pc do not buy
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"UMP45,Sniper,M203,G18 Akimbo maybe Iw is no have brain"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Welcome to Call Of Duty: Hacker Warefare 2
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,THAT WAS COOL
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,spawncamps. its a good game tho. i would give it a meh.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Definitely one of the better Call of Duty singleplayer stories out there. It will definitely keep you entertained for the duration of its' mostly four hour campaign.  BUT  Multiplayer doesn't work on Mac. It just...crashed...or goes int oa black screen only restarting your computer can remove. Definitely broken in the multiplayer aspect.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Just don't buy this game,its a waste of money,i am really sorry i bought it just because of the hackers and i lost all my attachements on a server and a hacker dominated the server,i watched the killcam and he was using aimbot:( i am really sorry for this game,it was the best game i had played but it doesn't worth the money,i would take my money back if i can!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"The game is good and all, but there are so many hackers it wrecks it. A couple of times I've joined a server and they are hacked servers where I get forced up to level 70 and finishes all the challenges. So for the hackers I can't recommend this game but the campaign is fun."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"The single player story is awesome. It picked up where Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare left off. With the 2-player co-op mode, you get to play with your friend to complete missions. Multiplayer contains more choice of killstreak. From remote-controlled missile to 10-second nuclear strike, multiplayer has been more fun than the previous game.  The multiplayer, however, isn't that great. It has poor matchmaking system and also doesn't have a game browser. The lag can be quite troublesome. The ping is stated as bars instead of approximate number. Hackers is the biggest problem of all. They can unlock every killstreaks, challenges, weapons, and attachments for you. This is a problem in the future gaming community because it will just lose players and Infinity Ward may stop supporting the multiplayer game in the future.  I rated this as negative because the multiplayer which is what making the game fun is badly implemented. It would be more stable if there are dedicated servers for rent to continue the fun match while maintaining a good connection quality."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Excellent game love it. But was only able to play this game a short while then was banned by VAC for no reason. When i asked steam why they said that VAC detected a cheat. I have never cheated in a game and mill kill to death ratio in this game should back up my story but steam thinks that their VAC program is perfect and this does not happen, so who am to defend myself against a company who is in complete contol of your games. So its no use me trying to defend my case. Its a great game otherwise, and i hope that no-one else has had the same trouble i had. I have heard of this happening to others and they had their ban lifted, but why hasnt mine, especially if this is the only game in my list that has a VAC ban on it. Makes sense doesnt!? Godd luck to anyone else who own this."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Terrible. The story line is weak and short. Multiplayer? LOL Yeah the biggest fail ever. NO dedicated servers, NO kicking/banning, NO choice in what map you play or any other options OTHER then gametype, NO leaning, unbalanced weapons/perks/killstreaks, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ respawns on overly busy map designs that leads to always being shot in the back by someone respawning or being killed by a camper, cheaters run rampant and are blatant because there is NOTHING you can do about them. Oh maybe VAC will detect the PUBLIC hacks, and ban them a few weeks later...maybe. It just keeps being worse. Lack of a console to tweak settings or even to display your frames per second!!!! Laggy as f*ck, as expected with no dedicated servers. Also what would appear to me, having their employees or simply people they pay to blatantly lie saying how good the game is. All of this for $10 more then PC games go for.....what a rip off."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,91 FPS cap and no ability to unlock via console like Black Ops. This game should be running at 200 FPS no problem. Why bother putting a 120hz graphics setting if you're going to cap at 91?
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,alot of people cheat from lvl 1 to 70 (i have and i gave alot of videos and screenshots to steam and VAC but they don't care) and they ban who they want........
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"single play is only thing thats good mutiplayer is full of hackers there are no dedicated servers ,i rather play Call of duty 4 !!!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This game had its glory days, but now the game might aswell be dead.  Currently everyone playing is sup3rl33t360MLGv1rg1nzzxxx, or you enter a hacked lobby and your rank is gone.  "
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,nothing has changed
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"After CoD 4, 5 the best part from this series, but only if you using 4d1 with dedicated servers, if you play with the lobby system good luck to find one which isnt full of hackers or complete morons beside the fact that every steam lobby lags."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Call of duty: Hacker warfare XDDDD
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Call of duty: Modern Warfare 2 (CoD MW2) is the game that ruined Call of Duty Franchise.   Let's start with singleplayer. Singleplayer and escpecially Co-op missions were still somewhat ok, but singleplayer also had many things that I didn't like. First of all the singleplayer was filled with too many cutscenes. At least I play games to play them and not to watch movies. Of course the plot is important, but too much of cutscenes is just too much.   Another problem was that the plot was just too ridiculous. This is connected in many ways with with the third problem. The thing that I really liked in previous Call of Duty games and especially in the first Call of Duty game was the feeling of fighting with other soldiers (unlike in most early FPS games, in which you are a lone wolf) or how it was said in the cover of the manual of the very first Call of Duty game: 'No one fights alone'. This no longer applies in CoD MW 2 and the games following it. In CoD MW 2 you no longer fight with large group of fellow soldiers. Instead you fight alone or with only a couple of guys at most.  Now to multiplayer, which was the real disappointment. In the first Call of Duty game the maps were larger and more open but for some ridiculous reason the maps kept getting smaller and had more and more bottle necks as the series progressed. I could somehow cope with that until this game and i might have coped with it still if it had been the only problem, but it wasn't. The main problem that I have with this game are its ridiculous killstreak rewards and killstreak requirements. In CoD 4 the killstreaks were still somewhat acceptable, but CoD MW2 is no longer an FPS game. It is a game of killstreaks rewards. That is just not fun. The CoD games after this one have continued the usage of ridiculous killstreak rewards and because of this I will probably never again buy Call of Duty games. (To be honest, I predicted that this game was going to be horrible, and as a result I didn't buy this game, but instead got it as a gift.) Multiplayer part of MW 2 also suffers from decision to not to have dedicated servers.  Grade for Singleplayer: 6/10 Grade for Multiplayer: 2/10  Edited 26 Nov ember 10:29 to correct annoying typo. Edited to change 'the maps were large and open' to the maps were larger and more open' Edited 14 January 23:26 to fix a minor typo. Edited 18 February 21:03 Lack of dedicated servers added."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,One of the worst call of duty games I've played.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,This is the game that I got VAC banned from. Don't buy it. Everyone hacks in it. Not one single legit lobby I can get it.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Game will not start and im very mad i Paid 20 bucks for this game an i want it to work !!!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"A disappointing sequel to one of the most solid FPS games of the late 2000s.  Released with no mod tools, dedicated servers or custom maps. To many, the hallmark event that turned the once-great PC FPS gaming into a consolized mess, something from which it has never recovered."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,This game got me a VAC ban on another account. The ban was wrongly placed; this was admitted by Steam and I got TF2 for it as compensation. The VAC ban is still visible though...  The game is not worth the money; The original MW is better...
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Like licking dog ♥♥♥♥ off the pavement.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"WARNING!!! If you join a XP Lobby, you will be VAC banned according to many people. The game is pretty good though."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Worst game I´ve ever palyed, RIP 25€"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,#NAME?
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"If you get a black screen, request a refund."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Buy it for SINGLE PLAYER! Online is full of hackers and not even worth trying. Even the hackers are bad because online this game is stupidly easy to kill people, I'll end up being the top 3 frags.  It's a good game on its own though, just don't do it for multiplayer because it wont happen."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Grr.  Ok, functionally this game is excellent. Lots of guns to shoot and lots of things to shoot at. However, the improvements made to these areas come at the price of the story and variety that CoD4 had. The result is a cheesy 'cold war goes hot' story where the Ruskies invade America that is just not very well done (if you want a good story in that setting, go check out the game World in Conflict). And while there is some of the sneaky funtimes of CoD4 that balanced that game against the intense firefights, this game is almost entirely big firefights. Make up a list of every thing you would expect to see in your typical hollywood action movie, and chances are quite alot of what's on that list is somewhere in this game. This is the sequel CoD4 got, but not the one it deserved.  Oh yeah, and multiplayer's here too. I actually did try that out in this game a bit, but after a while I stopped due to a mix of being terrible at its high-pace and annoyance at having few to no chances to try out the Spec Ops co-op missions which were actually kinda cool.  If the only thing that means anything to you is shooting guns in games and explosions, then you can have fun here. But if you like story to go with it, then this game will dissapoint."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Im sorry to say that this whole franchise died after CoD4:ModernWarfare. That edition was as classic as CounterStrike.  Yet they wanted to milk their gamers further.. and further.. and further and here we are 2013 around 6 games later..   No soul left in these games anymore.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,MW2 multiplayer is filled with hackers. No dedicated servers make it even harder to find a game.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,game is trash. i got banned for joining a lobby where someone gave me 10th.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Most people play it for multiplayer, but now it's full of hackers, so MW2 is kill."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,8/8 would not play agian
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Fantastic game, but all but died off because of the poor support by activision's VAC program that is woefully inadiquate at monitoring cheat hacking. Cheat hacking iswhat ruins the game forregular players looking to gain skills."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,I had my computer up side down
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"was good at one point, not anymore"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"MP review only: MW2 multiplayer [now] is a perfect sanctuary for mentally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ trolls. This acid cheating community is a wrong turn for those still sane.   Обзор только мультика: Мультиплеер МВ2 в настоящее время это не что иное, как убежище умственно отсталых троллей. Тем, кто еще в своем уме с этим сообществом опущенцев и читеров явно не по пути."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,  I played for nearly 2 days i encountered my first hacker He gave everyone fly hacks He continued to report everyone but himself for hacking Valve vac banned everyone on there but the hacker Hacker screwed us over I get vacced 10/10 would get vac banned again
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This used to be a great game but now it got old. Multiplayer is dead-empty, and even if you manage to connect to a full-populated match, 20% of players are cheaters or noobsters with G18 akimbo.  In short, dont buy this. Used to be a good game but it's worthless now."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"one of the worst Military games I ahve played in Multiplayer, the single player is allt hat is worth playing. Internet play is as loggy as they come and there is no Dedicated server, so you are relying on a Host that is probably infested with Spyware from the Giant Google Partners. Stay away from this POS game, because you knwo after you get threw single player your stick with ♥♥♥♥. Stick to Modern WarFare it's better, and So that you ♥♥♥♥ers know, CoD is on the Death Bed, and the Development teams are considerign the Suspenion of future releases. Right now there isn't a version planned for next year (At the Time of this Review)"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This game is bad. Very bad. All my pretentious friends told me so, all my normal friends told me so, but with a metacritic score of 86, how bad could it be? I thought while ominous music played in the background.  Pros: - spunkgargleweewee if you're into that sort of thing - burly white dudes kill other people with large guns that have military sounding names  Cons: - frustrating - levels feel all the same - the person you're following always moves too slow - F***ING GRENADES EVERYWHERE WHAT THE F**K!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! - is everyone in this game ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? - will make you question why you haven't stopped playing yet  That said, it's got good multiplayer."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"The most unrealistic, immature, stupid, over rated, stupid game i have ever played in my lifetime.  2/10 peas in a pod.  p.s. if ur looking for a rather GOOD game, stick with csgo. &lt; rated 10 islams / 10"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"The prize for it is too high, and in multiplayer is mutch cheaters and hack modes. Don 't buy this."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,worst game ever steam remove this broken game
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Back then I had no life.... ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. 9/11 would bomb again.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Enabled VAC again, no players online. **** THIS ♥♥♥♥!     "
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Does not have conroller compatibilty
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"No offline LAN, no mods, no command console, the campaign is decent but the muliplayer is a copy paste clone of call of duty 4: modern warfare with fewer players allowed per server, no server browser, just terrible matchmaking that doesn't even work correctly anymore. It's basically a console port. Buy Call of duty 4 Modern Warfare instead as it is actually future proof..."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Not balanced for lean.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This game is full of wanna-be hardscopers, 0/10 ***"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Don't buy this game, it is filled with hackers and is just not fun to play anymore. Get it on Xbox360 or PS3 to have a hacker free experience."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Alright folks this game's over ! Servers are now hacked or they are just down. RIP MW2
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"The worst bug i've ever encountered! Exodus: the laser sensor locks out after you die once making the game impossible to complete as you need that same key to finish the level (changing controls doesn't help either). It is a great game and I have played it on consoles for years, just disappointed about this glitch that wont likely be fixed since it is such an old game now."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"What can I say about Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare® 2.   Whenever I think of MW2, I think of bliss, I think of flying through the clouds without a care in the world, talking to our lord and saviour jesus. This immense feeling of paradise can only be achieved after playing MW2. Soon afterwards, people will try and stop your progress to Utopia. This stage is called chemotherapy. Ignore them and continue on your fast track to heaven, because after playing this game you will immediatley begin to die of cancer.   The amount of cheaters is absolutley ridiculous, it outnumbers the cheaters in CSGO by 300:1, and that is saying something. It would be okay if they at least tried to hide it because at least then I can try and believe that they are better than me. MW2, a game where its weird if you dont encounter mulitple hackers.   More importantly than this, the amount of ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥s on this game is even more obscene. Who opens up a game and thinks 'How can I be a ♥♥♥♥ing rat today?'. If I had a pound for every time I have been noob tubed, I could stack them all up, climb up and be the first man to walk on Mars. The amount of tryhards overwhelm all my emotions. I normally miss the final kill cam of every game because im curled up on the floor, sucking my thumb and rocking myself to sleep.   Finally, can we get chat disabled? Its either that or castrate every single person that says 'GG' after a TDM. Who the ♥♥♥♥ do you think you are? Its a DM, not ESL One Cologne you braindead ♥♥♥♥head.   In conclusion, this game isnt the worst game ever, but there are some points (highlighted above) that could be improved."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I wish I could rate the online mode some where in the middle because I do have fun from time to time. Unfortunately, I can only recommend a Yes or No. While single player is pretty good, the online experience is extremely tainted with hackers and aimbotters. The worst part is that I do not believe anything is really being done about it. I will admit that I have had fun playing online. But this really only happens if I am able to get enough friends together to start a party. To sum it up, if you plan on playing online, expect this: You will continuously be shot through walls by aimbotters, ruthlessly tracked down by wallhackers, rude players, the occasional dDos from poor sports that can shut your net down for a bit, and you will quickly discover how sexually active your mother actually is (likely within the very first match)."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,I downloded the game 4 times and restarted it 7 and I still cant play the damn game I expected more from Call of duty I will not recommend this game to anyone.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Lost all my game data have random classes made, lost all my perks steam what is going on!!!!!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,got shot by probably 50 bullets in 1 mission and regen health in like 15 seconds 0/10 worst game ever
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"i have not played this one for i was always a fan of world at war and black ops. but this one was said to be the best before the third game. well truth is i can tell it used to be but not now. this game is infected with hackers, aimbots, map hackers, speed hackers, you name it and you can find it. oh did i mention that out of the constant 300+ people there most of them are hackers? ya see i can tell this cause of the severe landslide of 10th prestige level 70 players with prestige emblems/rank emblems you cant get unless you mod or hack or have a hacker give to you. i was level 24 when this happened but i joined a server via random matchmaking que and it put me in a server that was really laggy. then after about a minute a player on the console with a rainbow colored name said ' everyone gets level 70 ' then a loading bar popped up on my screen that looked like it was a campaign hud overlay for a mission done in campaign counting percents. well in my console it was telling me all my challenges were being completed one by one and one after another. i tried to leave the server but it had been too late. the hacker had made my once FAIR level 24 profile a level 70 profile with hacked emblems titles and such. being really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off as i was i refused to play for a day then said 'might as well just try to enjoy the game' well among servers like that and other exploits i was also thrown into countless matches where people were running mods such as changing the team names of navy seals and the spetsnaz to '♥♥♥♥♥' and '♥♥♥♥♥'s' as well as turning off everyones loadouts killstreaks knife button aim button and replaced grenades with throwing knives and forced to no scope with a intervention. then there was another server where one such hacker was calling every single kill streak reward in the game all at once within the first ten seconds of the match. another server i joined changed the map half way through. and to further prove my point. there is a server that someone is running labeled as a team death match server but its a team domination server. the host of such server is running a aimbot with a 50 cal and every time he takes a shot every lags. as well as he has turned off various loudouts and changed what is in them. i dont think this game is bad persay. but it is infested with hackers and Infinity ward and Valve's VAC service that is supposed to maintain the game is doing absolutly nothing about such problems. i would say get this game because its a good game in the series but unfortunately i wouldnt even look in its general direction unless its playing privately with a friend or two. ( if anyone will play it due to call of duty's reputation. i for one have only few people i know who play it on my friends list cause of the fad of people saying cod sucks cause it sucks nonsense) if anyone were to get this game i implore you to not even touch the multiplayer functions unless playing privitely with a friend. other than that this game is dead because of infinity wards abandonment of it as well as the VAC service being proved to be really useless in it. RIP Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. we knew you well."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"(mulitplayer) Either you join a lobby full of hackers who lower your scores, and reset everything you've done, call in a nuke with 2 kills ect. Or you join a lobby full of campers, I'm talking hardcore sitting in the corner with an rpd silenced.... I even caught 2 people boosting once !!! and there's very few lobbies to join as nobody plays it anymore, you'll leave to find a new one, straight back in, I do not recommend you buy this if you're looking for some nostalgia, buy an xb360 and get it on there if you must, but not pc."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"The game in which the COD-series began to get worse, although I liked the single player campaign very much. The multiplayer section I really cannot recommend, due to the too hectic nature of the online experience. Everybody just runs around with multiple badass weapons and a loadout of superhuman perks. Just like the wet dream of an 8-year-old. On top of that we see the gunship who comes in when a camper gets a killstreak, and who seems to be able to kill dozens of enemies in or out cover, does not matter whatsoever. BANGBANGBANG I defenately would like that back in the days when I was 8. No sorry this is not modern warfare but a disguised version of DUKE NUKEM"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Its a Good GAME but i get banned from 'Hacking' Aparently playing with Self Texture is hacking yet i didnt even play Multiplayer Online. Best Reinstalling Game ever. And WAY to many hackers online *gets game goes online gets rank 70.'
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Was fun game, until I got VAC banned..."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"decent fun, cod 4 is better tho"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"i bought it and played it. only thing is saw in the multiplayer was explosions. i had no idea where people are, only thing is saw is explisons and death, it was like a movie from michael bay"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Would be nice if it actually launched consistently on Win 10
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Can't even ragequit.  Edit: Got the retail version so this won't count in the statistics. Just me letting of some STEAM here.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,mulitplayer guarantees a strict nat. prepare for lag fest. nothing you can do not even port forwarding or dmz no support from IW either
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, (This review is for the multiplaye because thats all I ever played)
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,I would of recommended this game if it weren't for the fact that almost 99% of players cheat and I decided to jump on the large bandwagon and do the same thing! NOW LOOK WHERE IT ENDED ME UP IN! I'M IN A PERMANENT VACATION AND CAN'T DEPART! Anyways... if your going to buy this game I stongly suggest to play singleplayer and avoid multiplayer at all costs (unless your playing with a friend) so you won't rage quit every match you join and keep getting headshotted by the same player 50+ and smash your keyboard.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,never use the liberation mod on this game u will be vac banned forever
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,dont work (muiltyplayer only) it gives me a error 51 and i dont know how to fix it so i dont reccomed
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Multiplayer is completely unaviable due to lack of players. This is caused by publishers or developers bad decisions regarding game servers. 
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Can anyone help, it wont start up (well it can but i hear a windows error thing) yesterday it didint do this is it dead or what?"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"CoD Modern Warfare 2 is possibly the best call of duty game ever developed. But that completely meaningless. All CoD games I have ever played have been unbalanced, felt horrible and imprecise, not been fun in the multiplayer at all, and not even had decent graphics. Don't consider getting this, unless you have horrible parents and can get nostalgia from it because they bought you an 18 when you were 4 or 5."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Short version: Ok singleplayer for $10. Not recommending cos the normal tag is (at least in AUS) $40 USD. Play time 8hrs 40min on Veteran (frist run)  Long version: Standard shooter. Still not as good as original COD. Stole a lot of it's missions from the original  (e.g. Reichstadt, Stalingrad). Gunning down civilians was a plus.  The difficulty of enemies is lame, brought on by implementing a simple AI that autoaims/wallhacks, funneled scripted moments, and overwhelming number of enemies. Nothing tactical or strategic required.  Weird autosave spots, like right in the middle of a firefight. Then not one for 5 minutes. Visual cues when and where you are getting hit from are poor. Screen shakes a lot for no reason (getting hit, heavy vehicle) Garbage stealth level where you kill one guy silently and suddenyl everyone knows. Unless if your sniper buddy kills him, then that's ok. Spawns enemies right on top of you, in corners where you know there were no enemies.  Can't tell who are the enemy, yet get a game over screen for shooting your buddies No continuity between one level and the next.  Some nice level design - felt that although scenarios were repeated ad infinitum - some of those levels lacked character, while others were detailed. Only allowed to complete everything one way (with a handful out of thousands of potential choices, with zero consequence).  Hold button until it dies works in 95% of cases Your allies do next to nothing unless explicitly scrtiped to do so... might as well be Star Wars Stormtroopers.  I feel there was a much better story here that someone sold out just to get it published. There were heaps of tiny details that were present just not utilised. Pity."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This is the herald of the end of good CoD games. The game that signaled the fall into a game series that more than anything are a parody of themselves. The final nail in the coffin was its successor, the game-turned-actionmovie MW3."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,i cant some how play with my friends join them or invite then but they can fix this problem pls
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,The last Call of Duty that has been okey.  But since last year there is alot of hackers and trollers thats why i say NO!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,cool game.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"When I tried playing this, I couldn't launch it, it would freeze or have a black screen.   10/10 would play again."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Vac banned For Chaning my FOV    10/10 IG MOTHER ♥♥♥♥ING N
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Where it all started to go downhill...
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,aint worth it 10 bucks is worth iit get sum world at war if ya do yet mr pickles as a big hairy ♥♥♥♥
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Before u buy this game make sure ur laptop/desktop is in perfect condition and up to date because this game is so laggy i could barely move the corner without getting killed by hackers. Also single player is even laggier but works fine.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I really like the game. I hate the fact that I have to deal with Steam just to play the damn thing when I want. I just wanted to play real quick for a few minutes because I haven't played in a few months. I can't because I have to wait 11 freaking hours for the game to update! Really?! I didn't want to play online or anything multiplayer, just a couple minutes in the privacy of my own home. Just because my game didn't have the latest updates was not going to take away any enjoyment for the hour or so I had available to play! I have had it with this crap! I have most of the call of duty games and all of the modern warefare games. I am going to get rid of them all in a yard sale this spring and as God is my witness from now on any game that has anything to do with steam is not coming in my house! I don't care if it's the best damn game ever made and the characters crap gold nuggets onto my desk! Thanks Steam for ruining these games for me and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off today!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Game was good in 2010, trash now. This game is so flooded with cheaters you'd be surprised to see a game w/out them, also, there's virtually no punishment for it, only a few get VAC'd, and reporting them does nothing. Not to mention the fact that there are certain guns that destroy everything else (Scar, ACR, Ak, Raffica, etc). There are certain killstreaks that are cleary better than other when it comes to effectiveness (Predator, Harrier, Pave Low, Chopper Gunner/AC-130). The tick rate + netcode are awful (you'll get killed around corners more often than not, when you see someone all you have to do is just shoot because if they try and hide you'll still kill them).  Stay away, game is good (kind of), community is more toxic than Chernobyl (Old COD fans would understand)."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,I GET IT IF I DONT BUY THE INFINITE GAME WITH ALL THE REST MY GAMES WILL ACT BETTER WOW AND I PAID FOR THE GAMES ALREADY WAY TO GO WITH THE RIP OFF. 
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,It's a CoD game.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,(Multiplayer) This game just feels like a pointless cluster♥♥♥♥ where it all depends if the enemy uses noob toobs to determine if you do good -__-
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"In most multiplayer games, kids like to adapt what I call the 'naiive driver' attitude, where cars going faster/driving more aggressive than you are crazy, reckless, cop magnets. while cars going slower/driving more passively than you are obviously in no hurry to get anywhere, they must be senior citizens in the driver seat and well the world would be better off without them.  This game is absolutely ridden with children like these. I consider myself a pretty good player (I get some ridiculous KDRs...) but as always, those who are better than you MUST be hacking. Those who are worse than you are ♥♥♥♥ing noobs and need to learn how to play.  In addition to the community complaints, I have a bone to pick with those who consistently use the most overpowered or trolling weapons. People like to justify this with 'its in the game', but this fallacy is overturned when they realize that metaknight is in super smash bros brawl, the moon breaker laser was in Golden Eye, and the 1-hit-KO hadouken upgrade was in megaman X. Just because the programmers of the game wanted to make a few guns easier to use and overall better than others doesn't mean they meant for the grenade launchers and akimbo glocks to be abused all the damn time. Yes they're programmed into the game and if you buy it you'll have to deal with it.  Pros: I liked the single player campaign it was fun. Spec ops are fun too. Cons: Community in multiplayer blows, hackers run amok ♥♥♥♥ing with lobbies and your customized classes and whatnot, some children will whine and cry while others will troll the hell out of u with cheap strategies and annoying classes.  Don't get this game I still play it because I'm good enough to ♥♥♥♥ with everyone. That's about it."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Piece of crap game dont buy to mant hackers :/
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,it is so ♥♥♥♥ 
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Hello! Just wanna say this: This game sucks! Don't download it its sucks! 
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Its Ok but 2many hackers
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Wont open or run, what gives...."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"A lot like CoD4.   The campaign is fine, but the multiplayer has hackers, which ruins the game. The multiplayer maps you start out with make poor use of space, and unlike in CoD4, where small maps had room for all ranges of weapons, pretty much everyone in MW2 uses medium range weapons. So less diversity, still hackers, but the game doesn't have all the mods that made CoD4 interesting, plus no admins.  Just not worth it."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"It's decent game. I'm still downvoting it, because I think it's unreasonable that they would release a patch that would stop the cheat codes from working in a game that still has some serious flaws. It's the same with MW2, and probably with World at War, too."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"1 of the worst game that i have ever seen. So boring, primitive, unlogical. I am talking not only about mw2, but about all game series from CoD4 to ghosts. For example, weapons. It seems that weapons' characteristics were written under tonns of drugs. .50 cal barret has similar damage to 7.62x51 M21 rifle. USP .45 has same damage to 9mm beretta ( 9x19 vs 11.43x25 ). Tavor-21 ( 5.56x45 ), AK ( 7.62x39 ) and SCAR-h (7.62x51) have SAME damage. .50 AE desert eagle has same damage to .44 revolver. WHY every CoD has WA2000 rifle??? only 200 rifles were made and nobody use it. HEY TREYARC! just google ' sniper rifle ' - you will find a lot of sniper rifles which is much better than experimental WA2000. About scenarious - yeah, bad russians and good americans save the world - very fashionable story. Nothing original, nothing interesting - just always make the same. About BO - this is the worst CoD even made. Its just epic fail. 90% of all weapons are FROM FUTURE. Game about 1960's and it has AK74, WA2000 from 1980's (!!!), GP25 and a lot of other things. Of course scenarios are the worst - tell how bad russians used nazi scientists and put heroes of ww2 into the prison. And it doesnt matter that IRL situation was clearly the opposite - americans used nazi scientists. Gameplay is the most primitive, unlogical, unrealistic and boring. All gameplay in 2 words - run n gun. Even Counter-strike is more logical, realistic and interesting than this. Freaking health regeneration - after .50 in stomach just wait several seconds and you are OK.  http://huh.by/uploads/posts/2012-06/1340985650_call-of-duty-vkratce.gif  - about melee fight. And about Ghosts.. dear treyarc, what do you call ' nextgen '? I have never seen so bad graphics, even RO1 and CS:S have better graphics than 'ghosts'. Gameplay is just 100% copypast from other CoDs, this game is still the same as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years ago, IT IS ABSOLUTELY 100% SAME GAMEPLAY - NOTHING CHANGED.   I think that treyarc just uses the brand, sucks money from blind people. I really wonder that someone still plays it and love it.  The only 1 CoD which i like - is the first CoD. This is the only 1 CoD where you dont have health regen, here you have 100 hp. Yea, its quite unrealistic too, but it is more realistic than auto regen after any wound. Only in first CoD you can place your weapon bi pod. Only in first CoD you can use vehicle NORMALLY, WITHOUT ANY STUPID LAPTOPS."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Bought game, Played for 15 hours, got into a modded XP Lobby. VAC Banned. gr8 m8"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Nat Type: Strict
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"The game is fun. Unremarkable and short singleplayer. Fun, but mostly abandoned multiplayer. The multiplayer community is split across a number of map packs. The game still costs a lot because activision is seemingly unwilling to discount it to a reasonable amount.  I would only recommend this game at $5.  I will update this review to be more in-depth at a later time."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I download it for 3 days,well, I wait it stuck in the start menu for half hour, it still ♥♥♥♥ing doesn't work, you mother ♥♥♥♥er IW, stupid ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. ♥♥♥♥♥ PIECE OF ♥♥♥♥, I tried 10 more times, wait for 2 more hours.This ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t just stuck. ♥♥♥♥♥ hacker, alright, never mind.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Look this is a great game, fantastic. But You can not play Spec ops with friends, and also can't join your friends in multiplayer. I bought this game for the spec ops, and the spec ops alone, and i'm afraid other people might too. DO NOT BUY GAME FOR SPEC OPS, DOES NOT WORK!!!!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"The classic (and problematic) mechanics of Call of Duty of 'spawn an infinite number of enemies until you go to this waypoint' are in full effect here. In a game that gives you limited health, limited ammo, and unlimited enemies, it very much forces you into a style of gameplay that may not be one that you actually enjoy."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,TOOOOO DAMN MANY HACKERS ( not showing off but i reached to a point that i played with no map just because i was getting my map hacked like 4 times a day and its realy frustrating repairing all the time your files and i was able to nuke many times ) but after a year the hackers just went off the charts totaly insane hacking on every game you could possiby search and as you entered theyr loby your prestiges reset to 1 and maany other frustrating tricks they got :) Plus totaly Removing Favela without fixing its issues with the whole insulting matter that went on with the toilet and the arab scribings on the portraits i personaly payed for this game and i would like the whole package that i payed of if you get my point cus Favela is still out of the search lists....u just got to set up your own game there and lets face it this game is to enter it and kill some people ( see the perks like comando = fast and slash not w8 for every1 to log on make the party and all that u just want to go online join search find game and PLAY the game not setting up the whole grid for a decent favela....

Then the time came, when you Owed to have Internet connection and services such as those steam provides, in order to play multi. Then dedicated servers seized to exist and games such as this, ruined the fun, especially when match making doesn't find any players. If you like fps and especially COD , play everything until MW(2). Your location might depend on whether you will be able to find other players and from MW2 and on, the game is more esport friendly, meaning for ex. Totally random spawns etc..."

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Used to be a pretty nice game, but not worth buying now as it does not work properly with Windows 7 or newer. Even in compatibility mode it freezes and crashes consistently in single player, so unless you enjoy playing the first few missions of the campaign until it freezes, crashes, and looses all your data and makes you start over, it's a pretty worthless game at this point."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Hello, thanks for reading my review. Hope yall take it into consideration before you buy this game.  Will it ♥♥♥♥ Your Computer: Yes. I'm not kidding. there are endless articles about it online. just go look up 'How to fix MW2.'  1. DO NOT PLAY MULTIPLAYER ON THIS GAME. it will break your computer. it gave me internet problems where i disconnected from my router yet my brothers laptop could connect 100% fine compared to mine. EVEN IF I WASNT PLAYING MW2, IT STILL RANDOMLY DISCONNECTS MY INTERNET FOR NO REASON, AT LEAST ONCE PER 25-30 MINUTES. i had to uninstally and reinstall my internet and ethernet drivers and it STILL did not completely fix the problem, even though it helped a bit.  2. it also broke my computers headset support so my headset that worked 100% perfectly fine before playing the game would not work at all. back to the internet problems, being in a skype or teamspeak call for too long while playing ANY game not just MW2 would also make me lose connection automatically after about a minute.  3. I EXPERIENCED NONE OF THESE PROBLEMS BEFORE HAVING THIS GAME, AND EVEN AFTER UNINSTALLING IT, NONE OF THE PROBLEMS WERE FIXED. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  4. My brothers friend who is pretty good with Computers says my last alternative will be to freaking uninstall and reinstall windows 10 tomorrow and we will see if that will fix anything.  5. CAMPAIGN WORKS 100% FINE. BUT ONLY BECAUSE THERE IS NO MULTIPLAYER ASPECT.  6. DO. NOT. BUY. THIS. GAME. I loved loved loved the xbox version back in the day but i sold my xbox awhile back and wanted to play a little MW2 cause it was an amazing game, but all the issues with it ♥♥♥♥ing with my computer. its such an unstable game holy shhhhittttt do not buy it. It will give your computer cancer.  7. its cheap as ♥♥♥♥ (like 4.50$) on ♥♥♥, which is a very trustworthy site, so thats a good cost if you ONLY want to play the Campaign. otherwise, do not get this game.  Rating: Gameplay: 4.5/5 Stability: 0/5 Campaign: 5/5 Will it ♥♥♥♥ Your Computer: Yes. I'm not kidding. there are endless articles about it online. just go look up 'How to fix MW2.'"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This is slightly bogus, i got this game mainly because i thought i was going to be able to controlably fight against robots in my own pick and choose scenerios. but the laptop version completly lacks the ability to do that when i did the exact thing on my friends xbox. i am very upset and dissapointed that the whole reason i got the game is pointless"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I would like it if it werent for the fact that after every hour I play of it, it crashes and my computer wont turn on for a whole day, and when it finally does, its still in game, then I can get off it, and that why i HAVE 15 or 16 hours on the game and like no achievments, its because I cant play the damn game.. other than that good game..."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Aside from 'No russian' i found most of the game boring, repetitive and stupid. I'm not a xbox fratboy or 12 year old, so this game just doesn't appeal to me."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Big piece of crap. This is THE WORST game i ever played, and i regret i paid 10$ for it. If you have taste for really good FPS games, don't buy this 'game'."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,This ♥♥♥♥ing game does not have hitboxes
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,too many cheaters and modders
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,This gam3 is ♥♥♥♥ thats why i have 1000+ hours in it
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,If you want to play the multiplayer without your level being boosted do to some guy with mods good luck because I got to level 5 then got skipped to 20 then to 35 and then I returned the game.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Don't buy this game anymore, there are too many hackers on now.   Honestly the multiplayer is so broken, it's not at all perfect, but because everything is broken you end up having fun."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Why is this game full of 15 year old dumb kids who don't even know what an education system is. This game on PC alone makes me want to sell my computer and buy an Xbox so I don't have to deal with dumb poor kids who buy alienware pre-built PC's and think they're insane.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"if aids could be contracted via video games, this game would be the main host for the disease.

Pretty much anyone left playing this game is a huge ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who's main objective is to ruin other people's experiences of what could have been a great game. Do yourself a favor and spend your money on something that causes enjoyment more than frustration."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"And then the bad Call of Duty begins.  Holy ♥♥♥♥ this game is just bad. It is not only bad, it's frustating. The killstreaks are too Op and the weapon and team balance is just uhhh. I rather buy call of duty 2"

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Amazing game for ret. ards! If you are a ret. ard, this game is just for you and doesn't require any skills to be a hero! Get yourself an unlimited sprint perk with a commando perk, which allows you to stab your enemies with your pocket knife for 5 meters distance! Spend your time on the run and stab mission! Not interested? No problem, you can just equip yourself with a M203 nooblauncher to get an easy and guaranteed kills every time you respawn! If this still isn't your style, we got another option: The dualwield autopistols! Take the Glock 18 to each hand and just run and spray it all over the map, you will get your free kills! Still not interested? Than you are most probably not a re. tard and the game isn't made for players like you."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,i love this game so much but if you want to get this game be warry of a ban i have been banned on multiplayer for no reason.although it was probably because i was in a lobby where a modder leveled everyone up.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,game would be better if it supported controllers. im terrible with mouse and keyboard
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Worst game series ever created, just terrible."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"In 2007, CoD:MW (Call of Duty: Modern Warfare) was released into a community that has a seemingly insatiable lust for more shooter action. They weren't just given another shooter, they were given a game that really pushed the genre considerably. Amazing single player campaign and adrenaline-pumped, fast-paced multiplayer action with perks and weapon sets set the new standard on how these FPS's are done. It left it's mark on gaming as a whole, so a sequel was inevitable and gamers couldn't wait. In fact - according to an eye-witness who works at my local Game Stop - MW2 '...became the best-selling game in history before it was even released', all being pre-orders (of course, #1 sellers are subject to change). Imagine their dissapointment when they got this...  Plot 1/10  ..was so convoluted, I can't tell you what it was. Everybody wants everybody dead except the protagonists, and the only solution is...killing everybody. It's a movie written by Michael Bay. That's all I have to say about the plot without spoiling it. If you don't care (which you shouldn't), highlight this big, black box.    You meet Soap in the third-person, but it's so akward and out of his character to hear him talk. Then when you get back to playing as him, he stops talking again. For the main character of the first game being linked into the second game, he's just so seemed; so tacked-on and uninteresting. All the characters from the last game are 'magically' back too, despite being shot in the back of the head with Desert Eagles. Captain Price is back, but his acting and dialogue couldn't be more out of character. He went from rough, clever, and a cold sense of humor, to this...My Little Pony....thing. He's overly polite with no backbone. Imagine Mufasa suddenly with the mentality of Patrick Star, and you're not far off. Further, everytime I hopped onto an escape vehicle, I knew someone was going to shoot me because it happens like 4 times. When General Shepard reveals himself as the bad guy, it wasn't exciting. It was met with a loud YAAAWN. The twist is where the game's story slips into a void like a balloon into a hurricane. The player also 'dies' too much. Not in gameplay, but more like a scripted event/cutscene thing. Once again, *yawn*. The only intriguing part is when the EMP wipes out most of America's power. You and your team navigate a deathly-silent ghost town. It's eerie and very realistic; the best part of the game.    The ending also plays out like every other cutscene in the game: 'Good job, now let's carry you off and tell you who the kill nex-' CREDITS; THAR'LL BE A SEEQUEL!  Graphics/Sound 8/10  I'll put these in the same category because I don't have much to say about them. MW2's sound and visuals are everything we expect from the series: excellent. The guns, the dust, the lighting, character models are all beautiful, and guns, tanks, explosions all sound great, too; so why an 8/10? Attentive gamers will notice that a majority of this game's voice cast is from Mass Effect. In fact, several things were just 'taken' from Mass Effect. For one thing, your CO's voice is the voice of Captain Anderson, and the voice of the general is the voice of Admiral Hackett. Oh, and the general's name? Sheperd. There's nothing wrong with being inspired, but I call this a lazy, rip off. Infinity Ward wasn't even trying. Maybe I'm just being picky, but this really rubbed me wrong despite Keith David's long career as voice actor for military-esque media.  Gameplay 5/10  Finally, gamers are starting to see the light with the release of CoD:Ghosts. It's the same. Darn. Game. Same rail-shooter scenes, same set pieces, same 'set bomb and run away' scene, same door breaching scene, same, same, same. We've been playing the same game since the original Call of Duty in 2003 and before that with the Medal of Honor series. It's been 11 years of the same game. It's time for CoD to die. You run forward, you kill the next thing that moves, and steadily march to the credit roll. Everything about it is so banal; boring to the point of painful. The graphics and sounds aren't enough to mask the bad gameplay and story. A pretty package doesn't make the bad contents good. You've played CoD before. Enough said.  Multiplayer also went downhill with unbalanced weapons and killstreak abilities that broke the game entirely. When you get 3 kills in one life, you get a UAV that reveals all enemies on the radar. However, these streak rewards stacked with one another, so you use the UAV to get a few more kills, and get a chopper. The chopper automatically gets you 5 more kills giving you an AC-130 gunship. Use THAT for a few more kills, you get a nuke that ends the game instantly. Sounds pretty ambitious on pen and paper, but in game it means: first to a 3 kill streak WINS. Hackers also had their way with the game and Infinity Ward/Treyarch/Activision or all three refused to do anything about it. I've heard rumors that the same hacks that worked on MW2 also worked on MW3 and Black Ops. Watching this trend, I believe it.   If you want an example of customer service done RIGHT, let's ask Valve. Some time ago, Steam was glitching up and improperly banning players from accessing MW2. Gabe Newell wrote a personal apology to these gamers, and offered them a free copy of Left 4 Dead 2 (L4D2). While that was generous and very polite, that might have been a bad idea for the poor people that play L4D2, because all the teenage @***holes from this game are now trolling the L4D2 community (as if that game wasn't bad enough.)  The Verdict  Visually, there's little to complain about. MW2 is very realistic by sight and by sound. Some of the settings are creepy with ash blotting out the sun and smoke rising from decimated vehicles and climbing corpses to escape combat. The whole world is going crazy, but they couldn't make the player care less. Traversing the beautiful world is an uphill hike to the credits. Yearly releases also means the community will be widely divided and chopped thinner and thinner with each release, so there's no point in trying to play MP. MW2 is big pass. Maybe get it for 5 bucks and beat it once. Final score: 3/10 Almost no reason to buy it."

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"What a piece of crap. It seems almost everyone who recommends this game is 100% nostalgia blind. Firstly dont bother with the piece of ♥♥♥♥ storyline that is so dry you could snort it, lets talk about the multiplayer, which consists of: run into a room, shoot, repeat. 'Oh, you shot a bunch of people real good heres another rank (the equivilant of a gold sticker in kindergarden)."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"DONT buy this piece of ♥♥♥♥ game.  SINGLEPLAYER  the story absolutely makes no sense. its just about action.  MULITPLAYER is full of cheaters, last stand, martyr and aikombo noobs that just camp, bunny hopp or lay down while shooting.  if you get a connection you play a few maps and then the connection randomly interrupts again cause the privat server solution is crap.  the game is also full of rank hackers, wallhackers and other cheaters and annoying for people that have at least a bit skill.  its the WORST of all call of duty games. i never wasted my money sucessfully like for this epic fail game."

Here's the ♥♥♥♥ing thing! There's a important reason why I write this TODAY! I've bought this game like one or two months ago! I enoyed it a lot til this day. Because when I joined a match today I stumbled into a hacked lobby, which is actually nothing in usual in cod as you may know, you just gently exit it... But today, I ♥♥♥♥IN GOT BANNED FOR JUST NOTHIN! It is just ♥♥♥♥in rediculous! I did not do one little rule breaking thing, and got punished for the 'crime' of another person! I even tried contacting the the staff, as adviced by steam... And this is what came out:    1 Message by you on Sun, 22nd Feb 2015 6:53 As I today started steam and thought about playing a bit Modern Warfare 2 Online, everything was fine. I logged into steam, started the game and finally went into an Team-Deathmatch game. Then i quickly realized, it was a hacked lobby. Since it was some kind of Snipers-Only match. I then turned around and went out again. Then the strange things started. Firstly my name was, for non me known reason, completely dark blue, as if I'd have set it up in my Steam name, those color combinations I mean, which I did not! I thought then 'it might maybe be just an bug...', so I just started to look for another match, another TDM one. But this time, when I'm entered, I immediately got kicked out and left with the message 'Cheat detected.'. I was just shocked! Because I did nothing wrong! I was not hacking at all! I just accidently joined such a lobby! I even asked, before leaving, who was hacking in there. A player with the name 'Progster', or something like that, responded. So I tried another time to play a match and the exact same thing happened. Until that point my name was still blue. I decided to restart the game and see, if it may goes back to the nnormal state. And so it was. My name then turned white (or orange in the menus I mean), but the ban still existed!  So my question is, if you may could reset the ban and instead punish the right perpetrator. I did really nothing wrong and I was so happy when I finally got the game. I just can't believe that I got really banned... All this happened like half an hour ago. So I beg again for resetting this somehow happened ban. This has already happened to me in the past, but I did not got banned for accidently joining an hacked lobby...  Thank you very much. - Message by our staff on Sun, 22nd Feb 2015 6:53 If you have been VAC Banned, the ban will not be removed.  For more information, please refer to our FAQs:  https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=4044-QDHJ-5691  2 Message by you on Sun, 22nd Feb 2015 6:54 But it was really not my fault! I wasn't hacking at all! Is there no possible way of checking this? 3 Message by you on Sun, 22nd Feb 2015 7:05 So this is what I've read in your FAQ: Q: I am a legit player but I am afraid of getting banned?  A: It is extremely unlikely that VAC will make a mistake when banning someone. Even if this occurs you can simply contact Steam Support who will usually lift the ban if it was given wrongly. Again, this is extremely rare.   So please...    Now you see, they wont even keep their word. I don't even think they read what I wrote there! I bet it's just somekind of an auto message! Since it was posted immediately after i posted mine. How rude of them! Im gonna be patient until tomorrow... But still, for everyone who is about to spend money on this, to this day its a pretty high price for the game, keep in my this could happen to you, too!!! ive read through some threads as well. I dont think there is hope for my siuation, since those people never responded with something positive again..."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"another crap fps, you dont need half brain to play it, just jump around with akimbo shooting everything and you will rule! cheater dominate this game.  can I delete it from my library?"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,There is too meny hacked lobbys on this game. Buy the Mordern Warfare 3 insted. just saying  I playid this game om ps3 for like 300 hours but the pc version is just  :/ bad
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Great game, bad anti-cheat. I have only owned this game for about two weeks and have already been VAC banned, for no reason at all. I don't hack in any of the games I play, and never have hacked in any games. I am dissapointed in VAC's anti-cheat, hope I can get unbanned.  Until they can ban players for legit reasons, I will continue to not play and dislike this game."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,i would realy like it if they added xbox controllars if you do i will recomend and fix the hackers i got banned because i was on a modded server and the hacker gave me a menu and now im vac i would really like it if you un vac banned me please!!!!!!!!!!!! i really love this game!! 
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Over-the-top military action, same basic package as Modern Warfare 1 but with prettier graphics and a bit more controversy. As usual, the TF141 segments are not nearly as fun as the Ranger segments, but they are the ones that play the story forward, unfortunately, whereas the Ranger parts feel more like afterthoughts.  Part of the storyline feels completely ripping off Homefront, story is convoluted and hard to follow and rather short. Barely 5 hours of gameplay. Glad I got it for cheaper.  Not even going to bother with the multiplayer...  If it's 15$ or less, not a bad deal. But more than that? Meh..."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I'm gonna have to say no. The gameplay and campaign are great, but multiplayer is the single reason I bought the game. Multiplayer is not the best.  Pros:  -Multiplayer is still populated -Optimized (Plays perfect on my GT-610 and i3 550).  -Fast paced gameplay -Good leveling system -Valve Anti-Cheat -No 9 year old cursing trolls, unlike the Xbox version  Cons:  -No community servers -Matchmaking system is out of whack (Look at my profile screenshots for details). -Asking questions in MP is impossible without being called a 'Nub' -Constantly migrating hosts in-game   If this game were maybe $10 instead of $20, I would definetly recommend it, but when the cons are compared to the price, I have to say no. I will still play the game, but will not buy any DLC from it."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I remember how few years back, CODMW2 was released. Some chose to boycott it, others bought it. Some hated it, some loved it. For me personally, having spent few good weeks in a decent COD4 clan, which at its time was a game, where a lot of DFBHD community moved to, I remember CODMW2 being like brick, which destroyed fragile dreams. Suddenly, there were newses about lack of dedicated servers, lack of mods support and suddenly - there was no hope that CODMW2 is ever going to reach heights of COD4 and its community - and if only we were exaggerating it - reality turned out to be even worse. Yes, I'm judging MW2 by the prism of esport gaming - one of my favourite memories were of a time, I spent playing COD4 in clan and then comes MW2 - no mods support meant, no promod. This meant, that all the balancing issues would pop up with high skill esport scene, were never going to be addressed. Lack of dedicated servers meant, there is always going to be at least one person, who can potentially react faster than others. There were DLCs - which at this point in time meant, nobody in esport scene is going to even play these few more maps. And obviously - then there was one of the laziest implementations of VAC, ever. And finally - esport killing FOV, set at ridiculous 65 horizontal degrees. Everything combined, created one laggy mess of a game, full of cheaters, only made worse with near unplayable FOV. It was a mess and luckily esport-wise got nowhere. But even skipping whole esport scene case - casual-wise it wasn't relly that good of a game either. It's just that PC port was so poor, it either made me feel sick due to low FOV... or made me quit, thanks to people shooting using aimbots, wallhacks and a tons of other crap.  Furthermore, at its time, I didn't really like CODMW2 for its singleplayer, either. I remember most of my friends being extremely impressed by its singleplayer campaign, but I found game's heavy hand-holding extremely irritating. If only I knew, this problem is going to infect almost the entire shooter genre... yes, if there is reason for what happened with shooters for the last 4 years - for the existence of atrocities like Aliens: Colonial Marines, Duke Nukem: Forever, Homefront and many others - it's sadly that other developers tried to copy MW2 formula, despite for the fact it does not fit and it would have never fit their games. CODMW2 was pretty much the first military shooter, with such an incredibly scripted singleplayer campaign, where a player is constantly hold by a hand and told what to do and what not to do - where to go. This is where linear shooter ended and scripted shooters started. Admittedly, all credit to MW2 - it still manages to make for some interesting cinematic experience and some action set pieces are really good. It's just a shame, player is so often a viewer of this story instead of a hero.  I'm going to say this - if you don't mind scripting much and being hold by a hand almost the entire game - and if you really want to know how the story develops after COD4 - if you can get MW2 on sale (5€) - you should have a decent fun with it. Don't expect however to play much of a multiplayer - it's essentially dead. For multiplayer - buy good old  Call of Duty 4  or much better PC-wise  Black Ops  or  Black Ops 2 ."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,all it needed was DServers and it would have been great :(  fun while it lasted  
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"this game was terrible, i had it for a weekend and during that time there were so many hackers, also you cant pick what server you want to go to, its all automated."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Decent multiplayer for sure but I cant recomend this game with the amount of cheaters unfortunately.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is the main game we point the finger at when we look at the negative aspects of Call of Duty, and rightfully so. Before I delve deeper, I would like to start out by addressing the controversy between Call of Duty and Battlefield. While I do prefer Battlefield, I do NOT despise the COD franchise. I had moderate enjoyment with Call of Duty 4, and a blast with Black Ops 2. However, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is easily my least favorite in the franchise. Without further ado, lets dive in.  What does Modern Warfare 2 do wrong? The first place is the campaign. While the story was decent in the game, it was a big disapointment. To no suprise, it is a linear corridoor shooter, as you mow up enemies and stop evil Russian men. Nothing new here, and there is no motivation to play the campaign. The only REAL motive I can think of is if you took alot of enjoyment in COD 4 campaign, and want to see what happens to your favorite characters in the franchise.   Next we have Spec Ops, which is a spectacular addition to the game. The minigames are superb in this game with great level design, and is a blast with friends. I took alot of enjoyment holding off enemies, mostly due to the replayabilty and freedom of this gamemode, in contrast to the Campaign, which forces you to put rockets on certain targets.   Finally we have the multiplayer, the heart and soul of the game. And let me tell you, is it horrid. This is not because the game is not 'realistic' enough - come on, we are in an arcade shooter. It is because mechanics are bad. Yes, they gel well, and the game doesn't feel clunky, but they are just flat out bad design choices. The first issue is create-a-class, which looks very dynamic at first, but essentially boils down to a handful of gun and attachment combos that are overpowered. This makes gunplay boil down not to skill, reaction time, or map knowledge - but who has the best overpowered gun. Same goes for perks and deathstreaks. I would have much more enjoyment in making a class, and finding a setup that suits my playstyle, in contrast to this game.The game also has no emphasis on teamwork, mostly due in part to killstreaks that cater completely towards racking up more kills. Not to mention, hacking in this game is horrid - but that is a whole 'nother story within itself.   To conclude, Spec Ops is not worth purchasing this game. While it is fun while it lasts, you will be forced into multiplayer, which is terrible. The games' mechanics only allow a handful of good classes, and that is the only way to do well in the game. Combined with a lack of emphasis on teamwork, the game becomes a muddled mess more than a competitive arcade shooter. If you want the best experience possible, I would highly reccomend picking up Black Ops 2, which fixes many of the problems addressed above.  "
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Heyyo, UGH! One of my worst purchases in a while.. friends told me how great this game was, and at first? It was pretty fun.. until people found the cheapest and most broken combos... like the dual 1887 shotguns.. akimbo rifles with grenade launchers and 'slight of hand'... made me rage. This game is so broken."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"ultimately i feel the games not very balanced amd very slow paced. As a casual game, theres more fun ones than this one, player populations are ok, but the host systems bad, ultimately not the most fun cod exsperience in my opinion."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Too much hackers.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Excelent multiplayer ruined by hackers. A good camain. Can't recommend due to number of hackers.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Was fun when it first started.. now its an abandoned mall in russia
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Camper filled craphole filled with stupid campers and tubers and 360 intervention PROs
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"NAT Strict, Lost Connection after 12 seconds."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Use to be a good game, but you can't find a lobby now that either doesn't have hackers or doesn't lag."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Someone hacked my game or something and now I get a map overlay on my entire screen. Very hard to play because you can't really see anything. I've uninstalled the local files and reinstalled from the cloud. Still the same thing.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This game was bad the way it was 6 years ago, it's still bad.  I'm not gonna go over an intial review, I just want to get into the heads of everyone who thumbed this up and want to know WHYYYYY did close to 12k users and 92% of them thumbed this monstrosity up? users voted on metacritic on average 5.5 out of ten from all 3 platforms with PC at 4.0 and highest 6.1 on consoles...  I did not forget why this game was considered terrible and the start of the 'Cash cow' Mass opinion which made dewritos and marijuanas popular Until Advanced warfare came out but that only put the 'Breaks' on the dying franchise.  Dedicated servers, Remember that launch date fuss? Nobody plays this damn game anyway and nobody wants to play running Peer to peer like it's the fall of napster or Bittorrent. OP guns: Intervention, ACR, Shotty, Care package, etc, remember these issues? Offensive missions: Remember, no russian. This was just a marketing tactic because the writers are garbage. and me, Why me? Because I supported this game, raged at it and spent over 100 hours in Multiplayer on this crap. (200+ on Xbox)"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I don't do the MP, so this is all about the SP. I put about 160 hours into this game on PC, completed all the missions multiple times on the highest difficulty, and have almost all the achievements. If I can do that, then better players like you will do great for sure. Overall, the game was not a waste of money, but it is sad to see a great franchise focus on the features I like least. I haven't bought a COD game since this one and based on watching other people play them, I am glad I didn't. If you want the best COD experience, COD4 or COD2 will serve you well. Never played COD3 since I don't own an Xbox or whatever console that was exclusive to.   If you liked COD: Modern Warfare, this game will appeal because it is pretty much the same game with lots of minor changes. It expands on the trends that set COD4 apart from the original WW2 shooters that COD was built on, expanding the special operations focus and focusing on bond-style villains weaving fancy plots to run the world in some way.   Technology also is greatly emphasized; COD4 was built on real weapons in wide use in the early 21st-century, while COD: MW2 makes commonplace what is rare or simply theorized even today. Most guns now have electronic sights instead of ironsights, automated weapon systems like sentry guns play a prominent role, and remarkably efficient UAVs with more firepower than a B52 menace the skies. If you want a more sci-fi than real-world experience of 'modern warfare' then you have found your game. Incidentally, the poor RPG7 rocketlauncher remains a big part of the battlefield and remains unable to hit anything more than 30 feet away without a huge dose of luck. So much for modernity!   If you like the classic 'common soldier fighting for his country' theme of the original COD series, you will be in for some, but not complete, disappointment.There are maps where average soldiers still fight average soldiers from other countries, but where they are fighting often requires considerable suspension of disbelief. What is clear is that COD: MW2 is continuing the trend of the franchise towards special ops missions where the real story revolves around elite special forces units who battle sinister evil geniuses weaving great conspiracies. Common soldiers like Paratrooper Martin and Sergeant Moody are very much passe. If you want Splintercell without the stealth mechanics, this will do something for you.   Like COD4, maps are tight enough to keep players from getting too lost and open enough, most of the time, to let players do more than simply charge straight into killzones. Some maps have tedious bottlenecks that will frustrate, so expect a few ragequits unless you are a masochist like me. So far, the grenade spam problem that makes many COD games very annoying is not too strong here; certainly not as bad as COD: World At War. You will have time to rest between rushes without too much fear of an endless rain of grenades appearing out of nowhere to punish you for your laziness. Infinite respawns are pretty reasonable in this game as well, so you aren't always going to lose for not having rushed after that last enemy getting shot.   One huge feature that greatly limits the appeal of this game for me: NO PC CONSOLE! COD consoles have always been fairly limited in their utility compared to games like Halflife, but for reasons that make no sense to me, IW has decided that players don't need consoles and so now players have no ablity to fine-tune their game settings, use cheats, or even fix some issues that could have been done in the past with five seconds of typing. This massively reduces the playability of the game for me. Before this game, I loved to see the beautiful animations and graphics in slow-motion. Can't do that here and that makes me sad.  "
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,to many hacked lobbys i got in to alot of them and got ♥♥♥♥ing vac banned wtf steam wtf
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Terrible don't waste your money!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Buy this if you are dumb...I'm dumb
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"To be totally honest, this game is not worth the money. Even on sale it's not worth it at all. The multiplayer is FULL of hackers. The only thing that's fun is the campain and the special ops but that can only last you so long. You join a game in multiplayer and you get all this op stuff... It takes away the fun and experience in leveling up. So you should hold on to your money and wait for another game you want to go on sale. Hope this helped '')"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This is a pitifully disgusting game now. ruined by hackers and little kids. hell both i should say. shameless lag switchers, aimbotters, wallhackers, hacked servers. Hackers killed this franchise because they have no skills and choose hacks to be better. No hackers you will never be better, if you use hacks you are less of a person and skills will always be better than hacks. and btw, you are not a hacker just because you use hacks, the person who made the hacks is a hacker, you are just subhuman scum in the gutters of forgotten humanity. if i was a zillionaire *even if that was a money amount* id buy this fncking franchise and set it straight, bring back up dedicated servers, update it with the latest hack defenses, idk theres sh!t out there. if it wasnt for hackers and little kids this would still be The Number One FPS shooter of all time. yes. im not exaggerating. But it is nice to find that one rare match where no one is actually hacking and its a non hacked lobby and acceptable connection, thats when the beauty of the game truly shines through. i dont recommend you buy this game, but you can if you want. i just bought it for old times sake because i had it on PS3."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Lobbies have nothing but hackers. If your looking for the game you played on your 360/  Ps3 then this is not it. It's just hackers, who can't be killed. Infinite health, 1 shot kill water guns. If you like hackers here's your game. If they annoy you then do not purchase this game."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Worst game ever. Soap and his ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mohawk...  0/10 Needs more hats
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"The best COD game I've played. Singleplayer is great, but the multiplayer sucks, just about everyone hacks in one way or another, and most games are modified or changed in some way. Waste of money."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"The singleplayer is lackluster, the multiplayer is horrifically laggy, don't buy it for more than 2 cents. A shame upon a formerly good series."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Marks the beginning of the end of IW and the CoD Franchise when this was released. What a terribly made console port that utterly shafted the game for all PC players. Absolute rubbish.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Hackers Galore.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Verdict: Passable  While more technically competent than, say, Skyrim, it's an incredibly jerky, ill-paced game that tries to do too much in its time span. Too many weapons, too many twists, too many bad guys, too many gameplay types. It's never really content to allow for falling action of any kind. As soon as you reach the final objective of a mission, it cuts to a loading screen, with hardly a line from one of your squadmates or anything to provide a moment of relaxation, a feeling that you've made it and, for the moment, you're safe. Alternating between the Rangers and TF141 on a mission-by-mission basis for the first two acts of the game ruins any sense of continuity between the missions -- with each feeling about half the length of a Call of Duty 4 mission -- further exacerbates the lack of fulfilment provided by the end of each mission, because each mission ends on a particularly poor and jarring cliffhanger and you're thrown into the rising action of another mission in another place with different people before you've had a moment to decompress. It may be that Infinity Ward was trying to keep the tension high. But, if that is the case, they confused tension with action. Yes, an all-out firefight can be tense, but it quickly loses its dramatic appeal the more you do it in a given span of time. And, since you -start- the game in a firefight and do little else besides move from one firefight to the next, aside from some parts of some of the TF141 missions, you're basically forced to keep an adrenaline high for almost the entirety of the game's runtime. This also prevents even minimal characterization. So, when characters are killed, there is no emotional impact because there was no time or cause for you to become emotionally invested in them.   Even the death of Ghost is completely forgettable, because while he's present for almost the entirety of the game, he spends almost all of it off screen, and never does anything important or unique to distinguish himself from the rest of the TF141 mooks during the brief time he's a physical presence.   While there are some things the game does well, such as the first mission with Roach and Soap and the way the end of 'Of Their Own Accord' and the beginning of 'Second Sun' tied together (the beginning of 'Second Sun' honestly took me by surprise), they are few and far between, lost in the sharp scene changes and deafening non-stop gunfire.  I'd be lying if I said the story lacked drama, but most of what drama it has immediately falls apart when you think about how ludicrous the plot is. The villain's plan was needlessly complicated, bloody, and destructive, especially given its purpose, which could have been accomplished much easier and cleaner with the clever usage of media and politics. But what broke my suspension of disbelief was not how out of hand it got, not how far off the deep end the villain had gone to even consider it to be a good idea, but how willing the villain's lackeys were to let him carry on and how freely they seemed to provide their assistance. It is clear they are trying to top the first Modern Warfare. However, the first Modern Warfare was already pushing the limits of reason while still trying to set the stakes high. Modern Warfare 2 front-loads so much ridiculous escalation, much of it climax-worthy material, that you really can't help but think every time 'It  can't get any worse.' And yet it always does, and never in a good way. If I didn't know any better, I'd say there was a team at Infinity Ward that did nothing but sit around and play 'One Up' for the entirety of the script-writing process, just to come up with new ways to turn up the heat, regardless of whether or not they actually made sense in the grand scheme of things. The scene of using foxholes and trenches to avoid machine gun nests on your approach to a ruined, Russian-occupied White House screams WWII callback. Aside from that, though, it does little but try to show the player just how bad things are in DC by stirring up patriotic anger. The same kind of patriotic anger that the game itself practically condemning, both in its plot and in the quotes that are displayed on screen after you die. And, by this point, the game has gone on far too long with its messages of treason through patriotism for that to be the point. Not to mention, the game isn't smart enough for it to have ever been the point to begin with.  When they announced the original Modern Warfare, Infinity Ward said they wanted to make the campaign feel a lot more like a film. And they succeeded. With a well-paced plot that followed a clear dramatic arc, parallel subplots that contributed to the overall scenario in a positive manner without weighing it down, missions that had their own miniature dramatic arcs, and the sense of danger and urgency needed to justify the faster-paced gameplay, Modern Warfare was a good action movie. While most of the actors went without characterization beyond 'Spec-Ops hardass', 'Military grunt', or 'Total evil psychopath', such archetypes are pretty much standard for military action movies, and they were neither over-done nor hammed up, and were almost always present, leading to a solid core cast you came to care at least a -little- about by the end. Combine that with carefully-placed and well-handled twists -- the end of Jackson's subplot in particular was wrung out for as much drama as they could justify -- it was a game that, despite ending up as the spearhead of the subgenre that has taken over the FPS, stands out as an example of trying something new with a franchise without completely butchering the job. Modern Warfare 2, on the other hand, is the result of trying to capitalize on the success of a new idea without understanding what made the new idea  good .  If you're  desperately  curious to find out what happened to Soap and Captain Price following the events of Call of Duty 4, or you just want to understand what all the fuss is about, Modern Warfare 2 is worth a play, with some emphasis on 'a play', as in the singular. If not, perhaps you can help unmake the rest of the franchise by silencing  its  truth, leaving only the deaths of 30,000 Marines, and the sacrifice of the 22nd SAS to avenge them, that the horrors of that week would not return to haunt the future."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I really hate having to put a game down due to it's community. I really do. But in the case of MW2, if your in it for the multiplayer, don't buy this game. If you want a decent campaign, then consider picking up this game. Here is why.   Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a modern-day first person shooter, but I'm pretty sure I don't have to tell you that. MW2's campaign is probably the last good campaign that Infinity Ward made. It isn't fantastic by any means, but it is still good, and instead of making it a headache to play, like MW3, IW made it fun, and creative, and MW2's campaign is enjoyable for those reasons. Maybe you won't be captivated by the story, but running through diverse enviroments shooting every enemy in sight is pretty fun, and it never really gets mundane. I can recommend the game for the story. But now, onto the multiplayer.   Where MW2 falls is in it's multiplayer. Now, multiplayer used to be amazing. The game provided sparse enviroments with cool guns and the same great game modes, and it was fun. Now, the game still has all that, but now it sucks. Why? Because, hackers. Unfourtunately, like all old games, MW2 took a turn for the worst, and the game is infested with hackers. Most servers are modded, and not in the good way, so the second you enter a match, you will have a Dorito's logo shoved in your face and some reference to weed. None of this is fun, and due to this, the experience is ruined. If you are looking for a good CoD multiplayer experience, I definately recommend Black Ops 2, it is probably the best Call of Duty to date. Again, I hate criticizing a game due to it's community, due to a group of sour apples, but I feel like this cannot be overlooked.   Overall, at one point, MW2 thrived, and it was amazing, and the multiplayer was awesome, and while the single player might still be good, multiplayer is just a shell of it's former self, and I cannot recommend this game because of that."

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Every lobby is hacked, basically unplayable."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Brutal online gaming. People love to hack into the game. Doesnt make the game fun at all. Please fix!!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Full of Hackers?. Yes. Matchmaking will put you into hacked lobby's randomly?. Yes. Hacked lobby's will ruin your stats and auto unlock everything?. Yes. There is no point of playing after your stats where hacked therefore you won't grind to unlock prestige. Only way I found to fix my stats to start from 0 and save my progress as I played incase I ran into a hacked lobby was using a program that would would reset stats and save my progress. After 400 hours steam decided this program I was running was a hack and I got VAC banned and lost my game and my profile is marked as a hacker. I wouldn't recommend this to my worse enemy.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This game is great. USUALLY. The multiplayer is next to unplayable because of all the hackers. You are most likely going to join a lobby, (which some hacker will be in control off) and get boosted to Level 70. Then, Valve Anti-Cheat is going to VAC ban you because you were boosted. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! It is a waste of money and a terrible experience. Everything else is great though."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  Don't get me wrong this is one of my favorite games ever but IW has completely given up on anti cheat and almost every single person cheats. Not like they aim too fast, like 4 c-130s circling around the map at once while the host flies around with dual grenade launchers telling everyone to get rekt I repeat  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"The game is very fun and an older cod that brings back memories... But the multiplayer system is hacked. I would have about 80 hours right now... but I just wasted my money buying a game that doesn't have multiplayer. If you are in a lobby with hackers, you'll most likely get banned. I could go on but this isn't worth it."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"i do not recommend this game, because in multiplayer there could be a hacked server resulting in unlocking EVERYTHING, for some people its AWESOME, but not to me because it just ruins the point in multiplayer with unlocking everything altogether, so i would like a refund because of that, thats the reason for MY refund"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,My mutiplayer dont load!!!!!!!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,12 year olds cussing more than sailors.... same BS game play as EVERY CoD... and players who in my honest opinion need to get outta the house a bit more...
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"So, multiplayer is still working great.  Not. "
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This game fails to load multiplayer on my mac, there is no reason for this to happen so I don't know why it does. I've looked it up and there are many reports of this problem but no fixes"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Community is ♥♥♥♥, gameplay is boring. But I love the kids screaming hacker &lt;3 10/10"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,My multiplayer for MW2 doesn't load. I just bet a black screeb
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"The online gameplay in it's current state (sept 16 2014) is unplayable, there are barely any players (300 to 500) and matchmaking is worse than ever. This game is overrun with hackers and I'm not exaggerating. My minimap has been permanently disabled from hacks used by other players. There will be at least 1 hacker in every game, usually more. I see people using aimbots in EVERY game."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This game maybe good on console, but on pc this game is absolute garbage. Its full of hackers, noobtubers and hardly anyone plays, so most of the time you run into at least 1 hacker per lobby.   I'm only giving this game a thumbs down because of how much this game is hacked. I recommand that is you want to play this game, go buy it on console because you will have way more fun."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Tp be real I have no idea why they say this is the best cod game of all time, maybe in sales. The game is ok, the multiplayer is crap because everyone is cheating, and not just a little, a whole lot, and no one gets kicked,to me it is the worst call of duty ever."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Not the best game to play if you want to play a FPS. Single player is quite bad and short, multiplayer is a non-strategical mode, just shoot and respawn and shoot more while being shot by 15-y-o kids who are screaming at his mic (and in fact are better at shooting and screaming than you).  Buying it for 25 euros was a waste of money and I regret it. Even if it was 5 euros, I'd be upset."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"It's now full of hackers. I decided to rejoin my nostalgic game of MW2, but as soon as I joined a lobby, I was instantly hacked and prestiged. Good, yet bad at the same time :&lt;."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Hate it because theres hackers and i got vac banned for no reason at all they have no proof if i hacked or not DONT GET IT wait for Black Ops III
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Got VAC-Banned because a hacker unlocked everything in my account (Still think this is total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.) Now I have a VAC-Ban on my record for NO ♥♥♥♥ING REASON!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"A great game, that is completely unmonitored, with hackers in most lobbies with the ability to change your rank and remove all of the weapons you've unlocked. It's a broken game now, don't buy it if you want it for multiplayer."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Pls don't buy this game. I've played it 3 days and have to deal with nothing but scumbag kids with trainers. save your money for something better than this
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Had fun playing the campaign Multiplayer was fun for the time I got to play it Left game to see I was level 70 Got vac banned can't play game anymore  3/8 campaign was good, but if you don't wanna get vac banned don't waste your money."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"A great game left to decompose.   As much as I enjoy playing this time to time, there are a few reasons why you shouldn't get into it. That's all up to you to decide however.  First, the good:  1. Fairly adult playerbase, I guess mainly because most are the original players from the day.  2. I haven't played Campaign in many years, in fact since I completed it, about 5 years ago, but I remember it was pretty good. 3. Fastpaced multiplayer action.  4. This game doesn't attempt at stealing all your freetime like some other games do, it's fun, but not addictive. 5. This works on Mac, I am not sure if other CoDs don't, but one of my friends recently bought this because it was Mac compatible.   Now the bad:  1. Hackers. It wasn't always nearly as bad as it is now. I am not sure how it works exactly, but InfinityWards seems to not have updated their anticheat system for a few years now and just about any lobby is permiated with a hacker as a result.  2. Unbalanced weapons. I'd guesstimate that 65% of all players use UMP, which is a clear sign your game isn't very well balanced. Some things like reloading on the Intervention has clearly been artificially slowed down, to balance stats out I guess, but still, it's not pretty and it stands out a country mile.   3. It's bloody expensive! I mean, this is 2015 we are living here and this came out in 2009 and it costs 20 USD, which isn't far off what it was at time of its release, I am thinking 7-10 USD maybe? I know it's CoD and CoDs must be expensive by law, but still... If you are going to have a 6 year old game still available for purchase, maybe make it more appealing by offering it at a lower price?  4. Playerbase is small, as You would expect, you'd have to work out the hours when most people come on, otherwise tough luck getting into a SnD when there's like one lobby hosted in the world.   5. Motherf***ing Kicktool! I am not quite sure where IW's common sense was when they allowed people to use that thing, my guess is that this supposed to let people rid of hackers, well no, usually it's used by a-holes to rid off people they cannot outskill. Very quite dissapointing.   I would pass on buying this if I were you, I am sure there are better options for your 20 USD."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,I don't reccomend this game it is a waste of money. I was just playing nearly level 70 and then i get into a hacked lobby i left and now whenever i go into a online game i get kicked for nothing and then it says 'Cheat Detected' but i don't mod modern warfare 2 and then when i go into a private match i see as a command i think and says 'Cannot kick host player' millions of times and have to reset my stats every time i go on fix this and i will be keeping it if you don't fix this it is getting sold
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,10/10 wouldn't recommend
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Single player very good, Multiplayer HACK CITY. Is terrrible, steam does not care, publisher does not care, do not get it."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I used to play this a few years ago and this was a game worth playing. The campaign mode was good, the multiplayer mode was decent and it ran smoothly. I have started playing once more for the past three months and I will admit. I have had enough! The campaign may still be good (although it runs a little slower for me now) but the worst thing about this game is the darn multiplayer.  Allow me to tell you why for this one very good reason in my humble opinion:  It has been hacked to oblivion- I click to play TDM in the game mode selection menu, I wait to be connected to what appears to be a TDM and I somehow land up playing Domination. What makes things worse is that the host can reset the match at the end without allowing you to change up your classes in the after match intervals. This means you go straight back into to domination ON A TDM SERVER CHOICE. This, added with lightning fast quick scopes, grenade launcher addicts, bunny hoppers (people whom jump and shoot/ avoid fire), spawn campers (sitting near enemy respawning places to get easy kills) and the aimbots makes for a very unpleasent gaming experience.   While Treyarch/Activision and ect will have likely to have been furiously working away to conjure a new way to make the public £100 poorer with a sequal to a previous title, they have been forgetting to make sure that their older releases are still being maintained for the enjoyment of hardcore loyalists to the older games that were released. No anti-hack updates or PunkBuster equivilent software has been created to stave away the hackers which suck the joy out of everything.  This may be irrelevant now as no one will be buying this or caring anymore. However I hope the developers are aware that yes, there are still people who play the older games and unfortunately people sad enough to hack them also (probably because they are better than the recent ones i.e Ghosts and Advanced Warfare in my opinion are enormous piles of rubbish trying to keep up with Halo). Getting back to this game, I would not recommend it because of how frustratingly terrible the game has become to even attempt to play. If you want to be hounded by the feinds listed above then go for it, but not for me as I have had my fill and so with that I conclude by saying: consider yourselves warned."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Stopped working after a week. Activision gave ♥♥♥♥ support. I wish that I bought this game AFTER Steam refunds became a thing.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,The baby one.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Any Call of Duty in the series will tear you apart. How you may ask? Well, Let's just say 'vocab', and rage. That is what I best describe this game. Also, this will tear your family apart as well."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,It Keeps Saying Cheat Detected For No Reason... FIX IT!!!!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Back in the day I would have suggested this game. I spent crazy hours playing Multiplayer Online. It's such a shame that the PC version multiplayer is dead now. I hear that Xbox is still alive. The single player was fun but short. Bad Company 2 was my next FPS and I enjoyed the single player more.         RATE:   3 OUT OF 10     
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Honestly don't buy it if you want to get a lot of time out of it and play multiplayer. Youtubers and reviews all said that multiplayer has a ton of hackers that will hurt your steam/computer and even some take out all exit functions. So I didn't play multiplayer, which is a large part of the game. I got about 10 hours out of this game before getting bored of it, and five of which were campaign and the other five special ops. Campaign is much better. Special ops is pretty fun, but it can be annoying trying to get new missions by playing the ones you hate. Overall, save the $20 and go buy Cs:go or Cod4 (which has multiplayer thats not hacked as much)"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Keeps crashing its a peice of ♥♥♥♥ 
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,don't make the same mistake i did nobody plays this game on multiplayer anymore so basically all you have is a 3 hour campaign and special ops that basically suck
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Best COD released but its crap now cuz of all hackers
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Each week I play it seem there are more hacked games and many more games with poor host, dropped connections. The CoD MWII experience on line is getting worse...don't think I'll be playing online for much longer."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,I would love to say a must have... but this makes CoD4 looks seperior. And the Yearly-New CoD game destroys this franchise.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Thanks for getting me vac banned. Although i didn't use any cheat :) because i joined a ♥♥♥♥ing hacked lobby so i am banned.. -_-
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Campaign is another dull, Brown People/Foreigner Murder simulator 2009. Lacks any wit or intelligence present in COD4. The multiplayer is hailed as the best of the series, but then again what do 11 year olds know? The only redeeming qualtiy of this ♥♥♥♥ fest is the Spec Ops missions, which are occasionally fun to play."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Dont buy this game random vacbans and ♥♥♥♥ for no reasons
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,liked the campaign but hate the multi player.total chaos
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Too many hackers.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Steam took it away from me after about a week for no reason i Called them and they said we cant allow a game like this is out web.site
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Multiplayer was fun for the first 3-4 months after release. No dedicated servers, Punk Buster or any post launch support to deal with hackers meant that after people figured out how to hack it the game was truely unplayable.  "
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,hi i get cod6 and i play it 9 hours and i get baned for no reason now i can't play and like evry normal people i get mad and i want to fix that s**t and i want to be unbaned to have posibility to play these game  Somebody how have the same problem to help me please.  Sory for my bad english
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,♥♥♥♥ this game dont buy its full of cheaters
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,so many hackers
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Fun for a while, but the community isn't as great compared to other fps games. Community is lacking compared to the CS series."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,The multiplayer is a hacker ridden graveyard. Do not spend your money on this.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Used to be a great game, Multiplayer that is. Now its just crap and full of stupid mods. Its no fun anymore."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Ok, multiplayer is fine and awesome but, the multiplay I just got VAC banned because since there are so much hackers it thought I was hacking. 3/10"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,VALVE SORT THE HACKING NOOBS OUT IN THIS GAME WASTE OF  £40
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,It is very good game but i choose the negative vote because the hackers ruined this game. 1.I lost my level progress by a hacker and i couldnt get it back. 2.There are a lot kids who kicks everyone out of the lobby except if you stand and they do 360 stupid shots. 3.A lot wallhackers and aimboters. 4.The nat is buggy and dosnt work with all routers properly so even if the port is open you cant host a game to avoid the modded lobbys. 5.They removed the Favela one of the best map on the game. 
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"It is a good game, but i can never get in a lobby with out a hacker! way to many hackers, the MOST u should get it for is around $10 $15. 6.5/10"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Alot of hackers on multiplayer. You will most likely get hacked to max perstiege and get all weps. You will prob join a hacked lobby on first try.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"The game is to short. 6 hours on normal mode, and i died plenty of times"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"1st of all, I HATE the CoD games, I mean I HATE IT SO ♥♥♥♥ING MUCH, but this game is different from the others. The single player is full with action and adrenaline rich. The multiplayer, well its still a blood bath but can be fun. But some other players included me miss some features, for example the Server Browser, the Mod section, and the admin commands. If you love the FPS games, its for you. But the kiddos can ruin everything, so sometimes the mute function the best in the whole game. I really recommend it!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This game used to be amazing in the past. I'm here to write a more accurate up to date review as of August 2014. This game is complete garbage now, with Call of duty 4 still having 10x the playerbase, this game has a flat 300 players for its playerbase, half the games are still to this day filled with hackers, and not to mention errors that this game comes with as soon as its installed, its a shame this game has gone to ♥♥♥♥, do not make my mistake and purchase this garbage, if you want something worth your money, call of duy 4 is still an amazing gem."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Used to be a decent game.. blah blah blah... infinity ward is a horrible company, never buy from them ever.... blah blah blah... what else can I say that will inform even a single individual about what a piece of ♥♥♥♥ game this is today? There is nothing. So.. if you've not bought this game for whatever reason and you're thinking about it. Stop. Don't do it. Don't ever bother with Infinity Ward again."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,I would totally reccomend this game if you are willing to go into a privat match with your friends and play against each other. Other than that no. The multiplayer is destroyed and not fun at all. With all the hackers its not even remotley fun. Makes you wonder why game developers abandon good games to drive people to the newer 'better' games like CoD Ghosts. Activison has become a money seeking company. One of the last good CoDs and will always remember it as a piece of ♥♥♥♥ game cause of my latest expirences with the multiplayer. And you can only play the campaign so many times before you are bored out of your mind.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Hackers everywhere you go.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,this game has a lot of hacker so no i dont recommend this game
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Needs to have the valve Cheat Symbol removed.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Very good game but to many hackers...i don't want play anymore...Nobody protect us from hackers!!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,too many hacked lobbies.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"It's hacked to death, spawns are broken, rapid fire 2 shotting guns, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ maps, and a terrible commmuntiy. Other than that it's great!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 was the most popular Call of Duty of all time. It has an engaging campaign and the visuals at the time were top notch. But its glory days have passed. The multiplayer is riddled with hacks and it is almost impossible to find an unhacked server. So if you are looking at this game for the multiplayer then I would look elsewhere. If you are looking at this then I would wait until the price drops but until then I cannot recommend this game simply because of its age and non working service.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Im going to try to be fair with this one as ive strayed away from the call of duty franchise for many reasons (the only one i enjoyed out of all of them was 4). The Pros: Graphics, Music (Hans Zimmer, enough said) Sound, and finally Voiceacting; these were all amazing. The Cons: No dedicated servers, extremely broken multiplayer (unbalanced weapons, broken spawns etc), no kicking banning or choosing map types either. Lots of exploits and glitches as well as hackers. Infinity Ward basically restricted the game from having any fun when you think about it. Personally i wish i could get my money back."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 was good when it came out.  Now it is just sad. With all those hackers and their hack servers sending you to prestige 10, when you wanna level up yourself and earn all those things.  i managed to get prestige 4 before getting into a hacked server which turned me into prestige 10.  So i've done my fair share of resetting. But then i got tired of resetting every now and then and eventually stopped playing.  Back in the day i would score it 10/10 but today i will probably score it 3/10"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"It could have been fun. But there are no dedicated servers, so one of the players is chosen to serve as host, which usually results in a terrible connection and a lot of lag. Once the game notices that, it looks for another host. The original host is kicked after the host migration (because the game obviously has to be as annoying as possible), and the thing starts all over again. If no other host is found, everyone is just thrown out of the game. There is also no way to kick or ban the hackers, which is great fun as well. The same thing goes for hacked lobbies - sometimes, you join a game that is modified, meaning some weapons can't be used, the game mode is different, your settings and stats can be changed and other things. Of course, there's nothing you can do about it. Dedicated servers would fix that as well. Of course, those are impossible, because Activision says so. Giving you the ability to play the game mode you want without lags and with the ability to ban hackers could actually make this game fun! We obviously can't have that. So: If you're lucky and get a host with a good connection, you can play the Team Deathmatch mode. No one bothers to queue for other game modes, because there's not enough people playing them - of course, hacked lobbies do have other modes from time to time. And if you're really, really lucky, maybe there's no hacker in the game either, so you can even enjoy it."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Got banned, kind of expected this because of all of the ♥♥♥♥ing hacked lobbys"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,♥♥♥♥.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Hackers are the most annoying thing, other than that its good. There are many hackers Always ruin the game."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"like every cod game the last years single player epic multiplayer sucks, only constant ♥♥♥♥ on tiny maps"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"would be fun, if it were not for all the cheating available."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,I am verry mad i really want my money back i bout this game to have fun but everytime i go on to a online lobby with a friend are fun is ruined hackers every lobby step up your game guys also my screen is glitch that my hole screen has a map on it so i cant even see the game with out pressing tab the hole game so i can see so please respond beacuse i very angry
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,No. The past is the past. ♥♥♥♥ this game. ♥♥♥♥ this franchise. And ♥♥♥♥ you.                         And your mom.                               And your sister                               And whatever pet you currently own at the moment.                       And the government.                      Did i mention that this game sucks now?                                
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Really dislike the multiplayer matchmaking system and I beat this in 3 hours. Not good value for money. 4/10
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,no i want a refund its to hacked to play
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Not Dank enuff for me too hard to 360noscope, not MLG!    But seriously the only people playing are haxors and the game is a poor port."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,this game so old there was only 2 dorietos flavors when it was made
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"'still rocks. no ded. servers but still better than BlackOps.' - Thats been my Review... until now.  Dont get me wrong, this game is awesome and I love playing Multiplayer. Oh wait. I loveD. But since they sued '♥♥♥♥♥♥♥net' and '4deltaone', which did a pretty great job with developing some modification for this game (New Gamemodes, New Maps, Dedicated Servers...) it just got horrible.  Sorry InfinitiyWard - but your policies really suck. No one buys this game anymore. No one plays it anymore. So why do you even care if somebody makes it playable for the last remaining fans?  'Black Ops' was the last CoD I bought after MW2 - and I did regret it - it felt like playing in mud... But those lawsuits against 4deltaone make it clear: CoD is dead (for me!), I will switch to Battlefield, DayZ and ArmA. R.I.P. CoD, its been a great time. ;)"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Don't even waste your money
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,I really liked this game but its multiplayer was ruined by cheaters and hackers &gt;:-[
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Umm this game is ♥♥♥♥ the gameplay is amazing its just i got VAC banned for no ♥♥♥♥ing reason so im ♥♥♥♥♥♥
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,There are not that many people playing it anymore and there are a bunch of modded lobbies and cheaters.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,TERRIBLE DONT BUY IT
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Guys i Download this game but how i change language from russia to english Pls need help
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,You get banned for no reason (Error Detected Hack) hate modded lobbys
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"first of all, COD on Steam? nope. dont bother &gt;-&lt; there are hackers evreyehere. its a hacker paradise. just get this game on xbox 360 and its not bad. mW2 is a decent game, but not on steam. the campaign is playable and spec-ops is pointless scince you cant unlock any other missions ._. oh and   Xxx_MLGFaZeCLAN360PU$$YDESTROYER_xxX  dont forget the dew and doritos."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"old, few europeans, all noobish russians playing causing ur ping to be so high"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,this is the most broken ♥♥♥ piece of people actually think this thing is good
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,to many hackers and i cant play becasue the update paused and the hard drive is full thats bull
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"The multi-player is hacked to pieces. If you don't have enough friends to host your own site, forget about it."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,I got Banned for no reason...... 10/10 would play again
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Forgetable shooter, played the single player campagn, nothing stuck out in my mind. im a big fan of story and fun in my games and this has neither, unless you are looking for multiplayer, avoid like the plague. there are much better games out there than this"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Great game dont get me wrong! I love this and would still be playing.. But stupid hackers are every where! My friend is now banned from modern warfare 2 because we were in a hacked lobby. YES, the hacker was fine, but not the innocent.. such bull****. He didnt hack yet he was banned. Good job VAC!!!!!!!!!! GOOD F****** JOB. Good game, non existent, I Bought it for PS3 recently too and hackers are there too. Sadly not worth the money"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,not nice you kan kill my brothers in it.....
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"great game worth your money, but wouldnt buy it if you wanted to play multiplayer as you join a game to have fun and rank up and automaticaly your max rank and have everything due to hackers who have made the game theirs by tuning the games their way, so they always win and you cant play the game you intended to play unless you host a private match where you cant level up  this is dissapointing due to spending money on the game :( !"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"OK, SO HERE'S THE DEAL: - You have to unlock gamemodes (Wha?) - No one plays search and destroy (Best game-mode) - No one plays anything hardcore, everyone plays teamdeath - Can't change FOV - No server browser, everything is hosted by players - No custom mods or maps - Can't alt-tab out of game when in match  Don't buy this trash, get a real game - GET CALL OF DUTY 4  - ALL GAMEMODES UNLOCKED AT LVL1 - EVERYONE PLAYS SEARCH AND DESTROY - ALL GAMEMODES ARE PLAYED 24/7 - CAN CHANGE FOV - SERVER BROWSING - AN UNGODLY AMOUNT OF MODS, CUSTOM MAPS, CUSTOM GUNS, CUSTOM EVERYTHING - AND FINALLY, YOU CAN ALT-TAB OUT OF GAME WHENEVER YOU WANT  HALLELUJAH COD4"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This game is good in gameplay and all that stuff, but there is one thing that makes the game unplayable, hackers.  Now, I'm not talking about aimbot or some lame exuse when I get killed or something like that. I'm talking about LEGIT hackers/moders.   Almost EVERY multi player server you go on, it will be hacked. I can't even PLAY the game anymore because some hacker put this GIANT MAP in the middle of my screen! Even if I restart the game it's still there.  They also have acess to your LOADOUTS too, and some hacker took ALL my items from me.  Would I recommend this? Well, maybe. If you don't mind all the hacking and taking away all your items and giant maps on the screen. Just maybe."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"It used to be fun when I played multiplayer with my friends but the game itself isn't fun.  The multiplayer is unbalanced, full of immateur idiots and lacks variety (by saying that I mean community made maps, mods and etc.) it only has few maps and it isn't fun to play most of them. To get few more maps and gamemodes, you have to buy expansion packs for ridiculous price and the game itself has ridiculous price.   The singleplayer isn't very good too. Its story is naive and illogical. It would look interesting probably only for 8 year old children.  There are only few things in this game that are fun but you shouldn't buy it for such price. There are more much cheaper, more interesting and more balanced first person shooters to buy."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,I would not recommend buying this game at this point cuz it is more than 4 years old. The game has almost no players left on multi player and most of the time you get the same enemies over and over again. Most of the gamemodes in the game have 0 players. In total the game has around 1000 players.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Well the bad thing is there are so MANY hackers and if they get VAC Ban, they just make new account and share their library.. so they can get back on and hack again easily so I think the anti cheat should work better to stop the hackers from ruining the game I stopped playing MW2 and barely play it because of hackers. GOOD THING: It's cheap, great game but just too many hackers. Hope this helped. If you get this game I recommend just playing single player and on servers with no hackers."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,played game got free ♥♥♥♥ from hacker. couldn't quit got a free vac ban 10/10 would play again
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This Call of Duty was the first step downward, and it sunk every year, even more and more."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,huge disappointment from CoD4: Modern warfare.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,dead game but for really i lied there are real players but they are haker))
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Just awful, avoid at all costs."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Its an OK game, but there are many hackers/Modders on the multiplayer side of it, witch i dont like."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"how boring can this game be? no one moves around, everyones sits in a corner waiting what a waste of time"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"With nearly a thousand hours played in Singleplayer and Multiplayer it makes me sad to give this a negative review now. I loved this game. I used to play this all f****n day long after school with my friends and even made new friends.   It used to be the best game I ever played but now it's literally dead except for hackers, campers and ofcourse trolls. To bad that the newer games don't give the same feeling like this one did. I guess it's time to say goodbye and finally uninstall it.  May my memory of this game stay always in my mind and the pure joy that I felt, shall stay in my heart. RIP &lt;/3"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"No dedicated server support in multiplayer. Not only does this mean there is virtually no ability to play on custom user created maps (unless you play locally) but it means you get put in games with no attention to connection issues, skill level or map choice. This one thing alone ruined it for me. If this doesn't bother you I'd say it's a great game, all of what you'd expect from the COD series. Haven't gotten much into the single player campaign yet but what I've played has been pretty decent."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,i do like the game but im consantly getting only one bar connections. can anyone help me  
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,buying the dlc broke my game and i cant play domination anymore
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Lack of players makes this game less enjoyable than it used to be.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Game randomly decided not to start after a new steam patch, dont waste your money, go buy the disc at gamestop or from somewhere that will escape you from steam's ♥♥♥♥ service"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This game is amazing, campaign and multiplayer, but when you try to play multiplayer, its like super rare not to end up in a hacked or modded lobby, I would recommend this game... but too many hackers "
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Even though my computer exceeds the minimum requirements to run this game, multiplayer still doesnt seem to start up as quick as the campaign or special ops."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,good game but lot of hackers. 
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Got VAC banned for random connect to hacked server GG
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,One of the best online shooters to date which is sadly filled with hackers nowadays.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"So... this game. This is also probably the 50 millionth review you've read for it.  The single player pretty much took everything that made Modern Warfare 1 great, repeated it ad nauseum, then tacked on a omg amurrka is under attack theme. It didn't work.  Some pros with this game though is Keith David. Because Keith David.  http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0202966/  - He can Oscar Mike me anytime he damn well pleases.  Other pros are the Ramirez, do everything meme. Regardless of what anyone says, that meme is solid gold and I laugh whenever it comes up.  The multiplayer features 3 maps, lots of optional downloadable content at cost, hackers, and ♥♥♥♥♥ing. If you want to succeed at this game's multiplayer, just attach a grenade launcher to an assault rifle, use the Scavenger and Explosive Damage perks, and provide your team-mates with some morale-boosting Heavy Metal micspam."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Twelvies. Oh God so many Twelvies...
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,This game was really good then i figuered out that they used the ending in the beginning of ghost
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,The community i just full of people who are old to this game so i reccomend that you dont buy this game after 2013 because youll just keep getting deathstreaks
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Great for a call of duty game, but compared to good games it's ♥♥♥♥"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Don´t look at the negative reviews to find some faults. Go and buy this awesome Call of Duty &lt;3
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,I would like to update my old review from back in 2014 in January 1st.  I'll keep it short by saying that I wouldn't recommend this game.  The singleplayer is fun but what most people are probably after is the multiplayer which this game is not-so-great with - maybe back when it first came out?  I find I'm lagging constantly (with good internet) and the game also seems to crash a lot telling me there are 'file mismaches' to which I've gone and fixed with the validation of game files to which the game STILL tells me that I have mismatched files.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Can't say this game is all that great anymore. The single campaign is just not gripping and lasts 5 or 6 hours at best. There are still some people playing multiplayer, but you're SOL if you want to play anything other than Team Deathmatch, Free for All, and Search and Destroy. Really only pick this up if you have nostalgia from playing it on an old console."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,5/10 lame propaganda. gameplay itself -get shot just get to cover and you will be good while everyone else is an idiot -runs out and dies from a few shots.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,there's a lot of hacker ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥in multiplayer
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"'Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.' A review by Richard Valkinsenn.  EDIT: My original review of Modern Warfare 2 has been updated to reflect my changed opinion of the game. I have a lot to say about it, and not a lot of it's good. The review is now broken up into two sections and will cover the game's campaign and multiplayer suites, respectively.  ---- CAMPAIGN REVIEW ----  Modern Warfare 2 is the pinnacle of the Call of Duty series, second only to it's predecessor, Call of Duty 4. Unfortunately, factoring in both the game's single-player and multiplayer suites, that's not really saying much. Campaign-wise, admittedly, Modern Warfare 2's campaign does feature a thrilling, well-acted campaign, and comes packed with thrills and chills, the latter of which is mostly contained in the campaign's notorious 'No Russian' mission. While the campaign's level design is linear, thankfully the player is given a wide variety of roles throughout the game's runtime. One level will feature a tense series of firefights with loads of enemies while another will have the player moving stealthily in a semi-linear fashion from point A to point B. As for long-lasting appeal, somehow, Modern Warfare 2 has a charm that has withstood the test of time.  The campaign also features a co-op mode featuring missions based on scenarios seen not just in Modern Warfare 2 but also it's predecessor, Call of Duty 4. These missions are widely varied and feature time attacks, stealth missions, and other various modes for up to two players to engage in. There are a few missions which require no less than two players, but thankfully, the majority of the missions can be completed solo, if players so desire.  Sadly, while the campaign and co-op modes are pretty solid, as far as a PC port goes, the entire package as a whole is found wanting. For starters, the game's options lack many essential PC features, like a Field of View (FOV) slider. In fact, it seems the developers went out of the way to make it difficult to even edit the native FOV via console or cfg edits. Not to mention the fact that the lack of separated audio sliders makes trying to tailor the game's audio experience to one's liking impossible. What makes it even worse is the lack of mod support, meaning basically that making custom content for the game is something that's just not gonna happen. Above all else, what makes it all even worse is the game's multiplayer suite, which only serves to highlight many of the game's glaring faults.  Campaign Verdict: I liked it.  ---- MULTIPLAYER REVIEW ----  Years ago, I played Modern Warfare 2 on Xbox LIVE and rather enjoyed it. However, having transitioned to the PC in the last several years and having played other, superior online titles, I've found Modern Warfare 2's PC multiplayer suite to be nothing short of a train wreck.  In addition to the glaring lack of an FOV slider, so much power and choice was taken out of the player's hands in this game. Dedicated servers, or at least a server browser for choosing matches is non-existent. Voting to kick or ban problematic players was left out. Mod support for custom content is gone. A much-needed feature like hiding the in-game chat log is just not there. And sure you could host a private match, but hosting a public match with custom rules and map rotations is a thing of the past. Well, unless you hack it in, but then you run the risk of getting hit with a Valve Anti-Cheat ban.  Then you get to the actual gameplay that Modern Warfare 2 has to offer... and it gets a little better and a lot worse from there. While MW2's maps are thankfully not as restrictive as later titles in the overall series, they still suffer from a near-complete lack of interactivity. Not everything about the maps is terrible, however, as they do allow for a multitude of different tactics and approaches, though this also applies to hiding spots and long, open stretches for campers to exploit. As far as the game's arsenal and perks go, there's a lot of room for mixing and matching to create a lot of different approaches and playstyles. At the same time, weapon customization is sadly hampered by the fact that only one attachment is allowed at a time, though a certain perk can allow up to two. However, adding this perk to a loadout means that no other perks in that perk's category can be applied.  Above all else, there's one thing that makes Modern Warfare 2 just about unbearable at any time, and it's an issue that also extends to the entire series, overall. A lot of the methods for getting kills in Modern Warfare 2 require little to no skill to employ. An example would be the addition of quick, one-hit knife kills that can be require little more than a button press, in addition to lethal traps that can be laid for other players. Several of the game's perks also exacerbate this, like a perk that expands the lethal radius for explosives or another that increases the distance over which knife kills apply. Not to mention the fact that the game doesn't treat fired shots like projectiles; once the sights are lined up, bullet hits are instantly guaranteed, no matter the distance.  Overall, while it has many high points, Modern Warfare 2 on the PC leaves way too much to be desired. A glaring lack of much-needed PC features along with an array of lackluster gameplay features sours an online and even offline experience with lots of untapped potential.  Multiplayer Verdict: It could've been much better."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,I got banned for nothing dont buy this game ...
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Joined 3 matches literally 8 people using aimbot and 5 people noob tubing FUN
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,This franchise shoud be call of Hacks!!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Whos up for talking about the campaign? NO ONE! There was a few nice mission but half way through it started to fell dull. The ending was super bad. Mute everyone in the lobby and hide the chat and youre all good. Try not to play scrapyard, its filled with people who enjoys the tubes. Its aged well."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This Part of the Call of Duty Frabchise was pretty much fun back in the days of its release, nowdays you will most likely only find hacked lobbies &amp; hackers playing online. Still it was much fun to play the first year after release.  Nowdays I would not recommend buying it, only for story mode."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Everything works fine except if you want to play a game with a friend. You either have to get extremly lucky and manage to join join a friends lobby/game or just spend ages trying over and over to join (No guarantee it will work). I understand It's a reasonably old game but that doesn't excuse one of the main components of the game not working.  So if you are looking to play with a friend don't bother. :/ Very dissapointed.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"MW2 single player is by far the best, but I would avoid if your looking to play online multiplayer unless you enjoy cheating, hacking piece of crap players that still suck even when they cheat...servers are all full of cheating ♥♥♥♥ heads that ruin a great game! generation of waste"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,It's a console import. If you own it already on Xbox 360 or PS3 then do NOT buy it on steam. You are better off with Call of Duty 4 because it has PC exclusive features and a bigger community.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Simply one of the best Call of Duty's out there, but this game is nearly broken but the hackers, snipers, and Danger Close noob tubes. Not worth $20 anymore."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Shooter on rails
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,COD SUCKS!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,THIS GAME IS HACKED!!!!!!!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,i was put in a modded lobby and then ban servers are bad need fixing still after so many years
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"As a CoD veteran (CoD, CoD:GO, CoD 2, CoD:MW, CoD:WaW), i was VERY disapointed with this game once i played it for the first time. And im still a bit disapointed every time i load it. Activision tried to be a hipster and killed actual servers the thing every FPS so far was OK with. But no... Activision have to make changes, even destroy dedicated servers in order to look like they're doing something out there. That step was a TERRIBLE, HORRIFYING MISTAKE. And unspeakable disgrace. With one move they destroyed MW:2. Still its a great COPY of a game, after a while you can get used to the damn thing."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"dead as all hell, and I have been nothing but apathetic about it.  although this game historically is strange, highlighting some of the most stupid descisions ever made by businesses- Removing dedicated servers, hogging profits, and just drama galore.  this was something EVERYBODY played, then modern warfare 3 happened, everybody moved to it and MW2 died.  it had something I did like about mutliplayer- and that is sustainability- a sense of progression, even if it is a stupid grind, at least there's clear and obtainable rewards. (too many F2P shooters and thier ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ EXPIRING PARTS, die please.)  after this game, modern warfare went down the damn hill, way down the damn hill."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,it was okay
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,The start of the decent of Call of Duty...
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,its ok...barely played it
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Nobody plays it................
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Black screen on widows XP I can´t launch it!!!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"The lack of dedicated servers really hurts the game, if you get into a hacked lobby you'll get VAC banned, plus nobody plays it, if you plan to buy this, please don't; if you are doing it for 'da ztory', just get another shooty game with a good story (may I recommend Bioshock Infinite?).  tl;dr fon't buy this, ever."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This is where Call of Duty began its long decline. Single player (as most of the game in this series) is good and fascinating and multiplayer HAD its good moments (TDM and S&amp;D) but the matchmaking system is really bad. As soon as Black Ops got released this game pretty much died and survives only with hackers dominating servers. I would buy this game now only for &lt;10€ for its single player part (if you liked Call of Duty 4, which is still largely played and the best Call of Duty ever in my opinion)"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Great game back in the day(Review doesnt show it but I have approx. 600 hours on multiplayer), is now a ghost town and run by hackers. Get it on console, you can get a pre-owned copy for less than 3 pounds, has *way* more players on it and less hacker while this still costs 20 pounds.  On a side note, the single player visuals hold up extremely well."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This game is absolutely ♥♥♥♥, too much hackers, campers and people that spray with G18s... I recommend people to buy ArmA or Battlefield instead of any of the ♥♥♥♥ CoDs"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,It's full fo hackers and good luck getting a refund... f**k this game.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Ingame Settings are so bad you can't change FOV or open console, its locked at what looks like 55 making unplayable while sitting at a deks"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This is my story. I've bought this game several months ago and I really enjoyed it untill today! From (Random date in the beggining of October 2013) untill January 6th 2014, the game was great I really liked it, but today (7th January) in every server I join is either hacked or looses connection. I think today will be the last time I'll play this game.   Oh, I also forgot to say, that I was level 42, but after a 5 seconds game in a hacked server, I got to level 70! I want to enjoy the game normally, not getting in a hacked lobby every time I search for a TDM server! These ♥♥♥♥ING hackers ruined my CoD MW2 experience!  THANK YOU HACKERS!!!  You may see that this review was posted on the 20th October, yes at first I said that this is probably the best CoD ever, but now I understood how much I was wrong :("
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Game is crud. Reported to the FBI. 10/10. I wouldn't even waste one hour on this pile of crud.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,I sunk an unhealthy amount of time into this game and truly enjoyed the competitive nature of it. Unfortunately the game became overrun with cheaters and Activision seemed more interested in churning out DLC rather than fix the problem. Because of that I cannot recommend this game and in fact have never played a COD game again.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Okay let me first start off with saying this... This game is NOT worth $20!!!!!!! If you're really wanting to get this game, please do yourself a favor &amp; wait until Steam puts it up for sale. May be a while down the road, but I imagine they will eventually.  Having played this game for several hours, I have gotten into several modded servers. Granted, getting into a normal server was as easy as backing out &amp; searching again, but the thing is, this game sees like 600-800 players MAX on a good day. So you're not always going to be able to back out &amp; get into a normal server. You will sometimes back out &amp; then just rejoin the same modded server.  The negative aspect out of the way, this is still the same old MW2 you played years ago. It plays just the same &amp; when you DO get into a noraml server, it's loads of fun! I've never had any issues getting into full servers either, so it's got that going for it.   As far as hackers &amp; modders goes, I have never personally came across one, or if I did, I didn't notice. It's just the modded servers you have to watch out for. Play on those to long &amp; you could get slapped with a VAC Ban!  All in all this is a good game, but i really wouldn't recommend it to anyone other than die hard MW2 fans, or people trying to complete their CoD collection. It's a dying game! Yes it will ALWAYS have a player base, (mainly the hardcore MW2 fans) but if you're just getting into PC gaming, or looking for a new FPS, I would tell you to buy Call of Duty 4 instead. There are 4,000+ ACTIVE servers in that game &amp; the number of active players grow every day!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"it was good until i was slapped with a VAC ban. i wound up with 0.8 hours on record from starting out, and now I can't even play it online. i did nothing at all, so I wasted the 20-30 bucks for nothing. if you want to play this game, you should do it on console personally, unless you can make a private match and keep hackers out. this one was the best one to me and i feel ♥♥♥♥♥ over this."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Terible
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Go back to CoD 4 and you'll be good.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,in my opinion one of the best call of duty games ever made but i dont recommend this game to buy  its because there are not a lot/none playing it...
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I don't really recommend it, But it's up to you all. I played a few days and a few hours. But all i see is Hack servers. Leveling up, people wall hacking, people using cheats to fight there games. There not really doing anything. Just let the aimbot do it for them. I do really miss the fun of the game where it was a challenge, now it's just childs play where people hack there way through. I guess I'll just play on the 360, the only thing I have to worry about is Modded controllers. But I found a way through that, so it's no biggie to play. Just if Punkbuster and other hack shields and stuff were more well equip to handle hacks. I would def. Give this game a 10. But all I see is 2. Half of the game you will mostly find just hack servers. And the rest is just that people are trying to play without having all this trouble. But some want to find hack servers so they wont have to play through. I find alot of unskilled players in this game. But I'll leave it up to you to choose whether this game is for you to play."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Do not buy if you want it for mac freezes on lowest graphic setigs
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I played the heck out of this way back in the day, but these days there's newer and better games to spend time and money on. Look for one of the newer Call of Duty games or some of the free-to-play games emulating it."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,I can't go back on call of duty modern warfare 2 because they thought I was hacking which I wasn't it might of been 'Cheat Engine 6.4' because I left it running all night
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Game was fun until the removal of the 4D1 client. Now it's ♥♥♥♥. No mods, no FoV slider ingame, just a joke of a PC game."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Doesn't worth 20$... not at all. Mulitiplayer is full of modded lobbies.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"So I was playing with my friends, and I knew one of my friends were cheating. But I didn't care about what he did and I just wanted to play because it was fun. So after some days he got VAC banned and we laughed at him. And the day after, I got VAC banned too...I have no idea why I got banned. Was it because I played with my friend that cheater or? The only thing I have to say now is ♥♥♥♥ OFF MW2"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"If youre gonna buy this for multiplayer, like i did, dont bother now because i played 5 games and every single one had been hacked to extremity and unplayable so STAY THE ♥♥♥♥ AWAY!!! Unless you bought it for campaign or spec ops or just generally enjoy having a srsly ♥♥♥♥ed kd and not spawning at all :D Enjoy!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This game is Good but not great. First off the muliplayer is a mess, in many ways it adds onto and improves on cod4's  mechanics (such as customible killstreaks and pro perks as well as more weapon diversity). But on the other hand you have  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like one man army noob tubes, commando, deathstreaks, Akimbo G18, and danger close that ruin the games balance and enjoyment.    The single player campaign is good and tells a compelling story but there are some things that aren't well explained and can leav you confused. The spec ops mode is just the campain exept with coop, fun, but doesen't really hold your attention for that long so feel free to skip it. But what hurts this game the most is the optimization, never in my life have I ever seen a game so effortlessly ported to the pc. The game is locked at nauseating 65 FOV (field of view) which will automatically makes the game feel weird to play since you are essenially staring through a pair of binoculars, thankfully there is an FOV changer that you can download for the muliplayer so make sure to get that if you ever plan on getting this game. Plus there are, get this, NO DEDICATED SERVERS.   Yep, no dedicated servers, basic pc features are non exsistent in this game! The lack of dedicated servers is what killed this game, instead of dedicated servers we get a crappy host based matchmaking system where everyone has to leech off of one guys connection meaning if the host has a bad connection you will have to play with laggy hit detection for the rest of the match. Oh and who can forget the oh so wonderful host migrations? Also the game is filled with hacked lobbies up the wazoo and some of them automatically rank you up to level 70 and give you everything ruining most of the replay value. Overall Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a disapointment and don't let any fanboy convince you that it isn't. I wouldn't recommend this game due to the how many asinine descisions were made with the port. But if you are still intrested in getting the game then be my guest, maybe you will be more satisfyed by what you got then I did."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"A decent game made when the iron was still hot unlike the upcomming title advanced warfare. (that game is gonna be bad without an ♥♥♥) This game added new kill streak rewards as well as more weapon customization which is not as comlicated as ghost, but still works fine. It was like it predecessor, only more epic and with maps that would become classics. And i must point out that the following titles never had any epic moments such as this game and with more bugs. (Kill streak rewards in this game were alot more rewarding)  But the main reason why i do not recommend this game is the linear campaign which is the formula of all the games in the series, but also that you should not support developers who desperatly try to recycle the old stuff, and add in a dog.   Consumers should be more descicive when ever they buy games. Without the money, talented developers wont be wasted on picking up the broken disc from the garbage bin."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,They needed controller support
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,its ♥♥♥♥
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I avoided this noobfest for a long time. I don't like Activision and don't want to support them financially. Along with EA, they are all that's wrong with the gaming industry. Finally, when it was $5 on sale, and I had done my google research to find that you COULD play on dedicated servers thanks to a community made mod. So I gave in and bought it. But then Activision decided that it was not OK for people to play their game on better servers, and shut it down. I should have known better."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,no server browser so cant play mods well. also you join some american servers so the internet cant keep up and ping is bad
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Pretty hight price for a forgotten child of IW. Game has no dedicated servers and instead they run on a players connection. Every match lags and host changes are frequent. I still play it cause of the nostalgia.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,WTF How is this still selling for $20.. Go pick up a copy of BF3 for free.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,5/10 Okay game in my opinion at the time. It did not do much to stand out with all the shooters that came out around the same time frame. For that it got 'average'. I prefer the realism and gameplay of Battlefield over this shooter. There are newer versions out there so I (if this was the only option for me) would skip this and get the newer CoD that has more 'realism' and overall better feel. Plus more people are playing online on the newer one and more players = better match making leading to a happier gamer :)
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"made me realise just how much better console gaming online is. PC gamer's will never understand how crippled their online gaming experience is compared to consoles in the competitive heartbeat shooter genre.   Games like this, Halo and Gears back in the xbox 360 days were far ahead of their time when it came to accessability [leaderboards, bonus perks, prestiege] and the tools needed for effective communication [party chat, all mics in game] were certainly there unlike the pc.   More importantly, it just feels like a quick console port, a downgraded product of what it should have been and that's exactly what it is.  It's puzzling that for a platform with superior hardware for the same game, the experience is just so miles apart. Console gaming really is better for online shooters. This game is by far one example of that.   Console Gaming- 1  PC hardware- 0"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Hitscan Russian and his 20 identical copies jump out from behind a barrel for a huge party. 1/10
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,dont buy this barely anyone play this and there are sometimes modder and there no mods to make this game better
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,U can get banned randomly permantly when u did nothing wrong i dont recorment it
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,It was fun till the moderaters start to kick players with tubes and other stuff now I don't like it that mutch anymore
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Well the story was deacent. My biggest problem with the game is that in any given fire fight whoever shoots first will almost always win. there is too much recoil from being shot that there is no chance to get returing fire on the targate. Also, the number of enemies in each fire fight just seems wierd, there are never less than 20 enemies to kill at a time, for one person that is just not right, it makes the game feel fake."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Now im banned for nothing really ♥♥♥♥♥ WORTH PLAYING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ OR 3DM GAME THAN BUYING BUT BANNED FOR NOTHING
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,The multiplayer is full of hackers. It is also isn't really built for PC gaming in mind.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Good until hackers ruined it.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,No player s online free-for-all ??!!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I like it, exept this is how it is:  me:Lets play some MW2!!! person: lets play MW2 and make someone mad! me:SOOO CLOOSE TO RANK UP!!!!! person: lets make him max rank! me:NOOOOO!!!!  so... in the end... i am like prestige 5 because of hackers."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Better than mw3 multiplayer in all aspects, and if u have a ♥♥♥♥ pc is better too, mine works mw3 at 50fps and mw2 in 80 fps, buy it.  30/november/2013: DONT BUY THIS ♥♥♥♥, IS FULL OF HACKERS OMG."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Valve Anti-Cheat enabled :DDD its a joke... lot of cheater, lol respawn system, good game with lot of sux thing.... now ~unplayable:D good game, but now i think i waste 25euro..."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"The campaign is short and boring with a boring plot and the multiplayer is extremely unbalanced and all the new features break the game furthermore. So you can customize your killstreak loadout, okay but a lot of them are broken and one killstreak is called the Care Package and it takes 3 kills to get. With only 3 kills you can get a freaking AC-130 and cut up the enemy team. The worst killstreak is the nuke as it instantly ends the match. There's a barragement of overpowered and underpowered weapons, the ACR wrecks all enemies and the M16 might as well not be there. The map design is horrid, offering infinite opportunities for camping. There's also deathstreaks which can increase your health, give you your killer's loadout, etc.  Then there's the community; teenagers claiming to have sexual relations with your mother, idiots who tell you to kill yourself because you're the host and the game is laggy without them realizing that the netcode is horrid, people who run around the map quickscoping/trickshotting instead of playing the game, people who intentionally make their loadout overpowered, etc.   It's a blitzkrieg of flawed game design and you shouldn't spend your money on it."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Even tho its been about forever since I played this poor excuse to be called a game. I still feel I have to report it.... The Multiplayer SUCKS. nothing but lame hackers who are insanly trying to compensate what they are lacking tho I have to stay clean and not say what they are lacking. Even if Hacking isn't the problem... and it, itself is what broke the game... the ridiculous Unbalance and kill streak rewards that are nothing but I win Buttons with stupid over powered AI aircraft and choppers will certainly take anything remotly fun away.  Ofcourse their are alot of people that love that play style which I have to respect. What I can not understand, is how people keep buying these series of COD, expecting them to add some kind of anti hack engine when you know after so many series they havn't and never will. Those people I will always call insane.   I hate this game so badly I wish I can remove this game from my library... NOT ASKING for Refund! I knew I will hate this game when I bought it long time ago... I just did out of peer pressure to play with my friends, so it is clearly my fault for buying it. I just simply want to get rid of it out of my Library permently like I never bought it."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,don't buy this game if you value your integrity. It's mindless garbage.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Better save your money and buy something less money wasting my friend!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,I bought the game for mac and when i start it 5 sec later it froze plz help
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I like to be somewhat aware of what's going on in gaming, and this is the biggest series of them all, but the premise of this is beyond stupid. Not to mention it's like a ride at a theme park - lots to look at, but just keep running..."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I would give the game a good and honest opinion on it, however there are too many hackers that aren't being taken care of. You either get kicked or get all your perks and weapons demoted. Unless you really enjoy the game and is willing to earn all your guns and perks back after getting demoted at least once a week, then this is the game for you."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,amazing single player and fun multiplayer!  edit: full of hackers these days 7/10
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"R.I.P COD, this was the last good game that came out and was ruined by the stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who hacked and programmed it"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Keep firing, @$$holes!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,One of the ♥♥♥♥♥iest games I've ever been conned into buying by the 'review' industry.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Multiplayer is broken, don't bother. They're not going to fix it any time soon. If you play CoD games solely for the single player campaign, then whatever, but if you play CoD just for the multiplayer, you'll find that you'll enter a hacked lobby and you'll have your UI messed up and that the game will be totally unplayable and it won't matter if you reinstall the game because the problem will persist."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I always loved MW2 yet on PC it isn't good. I would reccomend this game to someone when it first came out but now just save your money. Almost every game you join there is a hacker in the lobby ruining the game. I was hoping to play it legitly but that was not going to happen. The minute I left I was 10th Prestige and level 70. Ontop of that this game issued a VAC ban on my profile for 'cheating'. The reason being is that I installed a custom weapon camo. Nobody else could see it so it was only changing my expirience, not theirs. Its funny how all the millions of hackers on this game get off the hook for hosting lobbies and using aimbot and the minute I use a simple weapon camo I am banned. From a game that came out in 2009 VAC bans should really be a thing of the past. If you want the game for the campaign go ahead but forget about the multiplayer. Its time is over and now modders are in every lobby."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a 2009 first-person shooter video game developed by Infinity Ward and published by Activision. The game is a sequel of the hit game, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare however it did not live up to the original. In my opinion the franchise started to do very poorly from here. Every COD game started to feel like copies with different maps and guns but the same engine. One of the biggest issues were that if you got a certain amount of kills in a row you can nuke the game and your team wins even if your team was losing and the other team was about to win. In theory it only take the effort of one person to win the round."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"My time played on record only shows single player activity, as STEAM separates the two (single and multiplayer). My total time played in Multiplayer is 970 hours.  Update: Now that the game is infested with hackers, I can no longer recommend it. It isn't a rare to end up in a hacked lobby which will do anything from deranking you to altering your unlocks to changing settings in your mp config file. Playing the game requires keeping backups of all your stats and MP files. More information about this can be found in the forums, so if you are considering the game at this point, be sure to inform yourself about all of the serious issues affecting it. It may not be worth the hassle.  Is the game playable and fun? Sure. And in some instances, when you find a good host and players who want to have an enjoyable time without noob tubes, commando, or other nonsense, it can be really fun. But just beware, it's infested with hacked lobbies, people running exploits, and a less than respectable community. If you can stomach all that, you can find fun in it.  *Original Review:  Quick pacing and nonstop action keeps you moving forward to the inevitable end game of the single player at around a 5 to 8 hour completion time. This is good if you are looking to jump into playing an hour or so at a time as each chapter of the campaign is relatively short. The action on display is compelling and the thrilling score, outstanding militaristic dialogue, and visceral imagery keep things constantly engaging. The story, as epically scaled as it may be, is a little too contrived. Modern Warfare 2 decides to up the ante with a full scale invasion of the United States. The U.S. is under siege and the stakes are high. It is unfortunate then that the reasoning behind the whole ordeal, while tragic, is somewhat farfetched. The multiplayer is excellent, yes, with superb shooter mechanics and fluid gameplay. It is also somewhat rage inducing. Prepare to be noob tubed to kingdom come. That aside, it is fast and great fun."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,What was I thinking?!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Good Game  Edit: NOT! Noobtuber and campers everywere
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,says its for mac but cant play it??? 
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Got into a hacked lobby, got VAC banned"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Multiplayer is 12-year-olds and hackers that think it's fun to mod in low gravity and infinite ammo.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"if anyone asked me for couple of years ago, Ill be recommend it to others, now I dont, too many cheaters in this game, and for sure its really sad, cuz its actually a pretty good game, too bad with the cheating stuff..!"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,This is my favorite game. But I allowed my friend to control my computer over an application and he gave me hacks for the game. I did not want them he said it'll be a surprise. I was then VAC Banned for somehthing I did not do. ♥♥♥♥ you steam.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Requires almost no skill and is riddled with DLC and probably still is with hackers.  If you've played one of them, you've played all of them. Save yourself the grenade spam and skip CoD. There are far better games in this genre and recent CoD/Battlefield titles are definitely not one of them."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Why did I let myself play so much of this game? Man, I was a f*ckin' dumb teenager.    0 out of 360 no-scopes. "
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"The PC Port for this game is TERRIBLE!  1.Thanks to it now having the match making system, you can get put in hacked lobbies, which happens a lot! 2:There are no dedicated servers which means if you want to make a server for everyone to join, can't do that anymore 3:There is no more Server Browser, which means you can't choose what game to join, which means you can't join a non hacked game I mean the game is fun and all when you not in a hacked lobby, but with these 3 main problems, I just really can't enjoy this game. Overall Rating 5/10 If this were the Console Verison 8/10"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"When I was younger I really enjoyed this game. I enjoyed the campaign. I enjoyed the multiplayer. I enjoyed the guns. Everything. I guess I grew up, because now the linear campaign feels claustrophobic to the point that it's not remotely enjoyable. The multiplayer still has all the same problems that made people ragequit years ago. Crappy spawn system, terrible hitboxes, ridiculous kill streaks, annoying death streaks, and so much more. I will say that the multiplayer maps themselves are very memorable and it feels good revisiting them. To conclude I don't think this game is worth the 20$ price tag. There are so many better games on here with more to offer that cost less than 20$. So yeah, my opinion."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,why do maps cost ? i bought the game its stupid how u whant more money !
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,i cant find any server for multiplayer
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,cant open it
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This piece of crap runs like ♥♥♥♥! Freezing, crashing, and bugs."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,If you want to play the MP just don't. Most but not all lobbys are hacked. It is really hard to get into a lobby that is not hacked. To me the story is good. There are a desent amount of weapon. Good game. But if you want it due to MP DON'T BUY IT.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,nahh seriously it sucks
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Got into a modded lobby, got prestige 10, level 70 and EVERYTHING unlocked, and then got VAC banned, wouldn't recommend to anyone"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,do not buy MW2 if you want to play multiplayer thar to tuns of hackers i onley played 5 hours and got my leveo hacked 2 time and was in mor than 10 hacked lobbys i wood not buy MW2 for multiplayer
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,if the game didnt contain mods and it had dedicated servers it would be fine
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,In my opinion? Not worth the money
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"single player thumbs up co-op thumbs up multi-player lan thumbs up  Multi-player with Valve's anti cheat two thumbs down. The multitude of cheaters and hackers that run rampat on there servers leaves me with no faith in any of steams anti cheat systems. If at very least you had the ability to ban a person to letting join a game your in, you could at least avoid some of them.  Can happen often you join a hacked server, leave it trying to find another game and you join right back into the same server. Valves anti-cheat says it bans cheaters and catchest them however many times its very obvious the cheaters are there and wrecking any entertainment you would have. Unfortunatly if you wish to play lan games and you would like to use more then the basic weapons attachments perks etc. you are forced to play with these poor servers and players with hacks and cheats running. Some of these hacks are minor however most are disruptive (like people deciding to summon boxes and create walls or houses, others try to not be so obvious only using target assist creating multiple increadable kills only seen in movies, some of these are hard to determine because some good players abound with impressive kills and you have to experience multiple incredable deaths untill you can assume there is some hack running. The worst is when someone hijacks a server creating bizzare events of people jumping increadable heights and weapon crates falling from the sky.  The old school way of allowing people to host and control there own network games was far superior there you would be able save servers that were running things fair or in settings you appreciate, and the server controllers could at will ban players they felt were not following there own rules and or seamed to be cheating.  Valves attempt at elliminating cheaters is iether forgotten about with this old game, which leaves me wondering if any of the newer games I may be on the fence of purchasing is worth the hassel of purchasing.  the VAC and forced playing multiple online games before it open weapon options during lan are the only negative to this game,"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,♥♥♥♥ing banned for no ♥♥♥♥ing reason please remove my ban i am so mad 
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Too many hackers i got V.A.C. banned becase of them
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"The word 'hooahh' belongs in movies, not video games. Scratch that, hooah doesn't belong anywhere."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,this game with no offline split screen on pc is preety much useless. console version much better with it ...
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,This game is broken multiplayer is full of a ♥♥♥♥! and players are idiots they make this game full of ♥♥♥♥ everybody are using guns what are OP like G18 akimbo Granade launcher and that is ♥♥♥♥ing ridiculus and this game is full of hackers dont buy this if u rage much
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Valve Anti-Cheat decided to ban me from the game because some a**hole decided to change my stats after I was put in a multiplayer modded-lobby. Come on Valve, get your ♥♥♥♥ together. Now I have this annoying VAC ban on my record when I literally never did anything. What a mess."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,+Co-Op  -Re used maps from 'old' cod 'games'  +Singleplayer takes some time to complete.  -Get's repedetive.  -Still no FoV option. -Server browser is only avible if you cracked your game wich is not legal. (Makes me wonder why the ♥♥♥♥ pirates get's the beter Version?!?!)  
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"do not buy, even though this game is amazing. the online is unplayable due to the lack of players. 90% of the time you will join hack matches, i really wish the devs could do something about the hackers. but they are no going to do that beacause its an 'old game'. i recommend this game for the story. :("
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I liked the multiplayer very much, played it for many hours.  But the host system and the resulting hacker overrun ruined everything.  So at last I cannot recommend getting this any longer."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Full of Hackers and Hacked Lobbies
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Yes I am a little behind the times , its a old game . But the people that play this game are the most rude and racisit assbags I have ever met . I play two games on steam so far , killing floor which by far has the most likeable players I have ever met , even made friends with a few but this game , I really regret buying it . Oh it had great graphics , but that is about it . Way to confusing for a first timer plus no way that I found so far to balance the game play . I get tossed into a game with level 70 players I may as well just stay in one spot and be target practice . Maybe MW3 is better but I do not think the price on either of these games just because of the community is worth it . If I want abuse I will go and find a girlfriend into bondage , not some 20 something neckbeard who had played the game forever . Just wish I vould get my money back ."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Singleplayer: Awesome, amazing story  Muletiplayer: take 10 minutes to find a server"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ game. A LOT OF HACKERS! Buy battlefield bad company 2 instead of this ♥♥♥♥ game.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Seems like a good game but it keeps on crashing with my Radeon HD7870 card with Windows 10.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"meh, good game, too many cheaters"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"For it's $20 dollar price tag it's probably one of the best choices for Call of Duty's out there. The main problem being is that there's a large amount of hackers in the game, or hacked lobbies. Still, you you want an occasional Call of Duty game to play, this might be a good pick up."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Single Player:   Pros:  Simple. Clean. Fun. Fun missions that are well designed and complex. Game mechanics are an improvement compared to COD 4.  Cons:  Terrible Storyline. Get's boring. I can only play it for like 45 minutes in one sitting until I get bored out of my mind.   Multiplayer: Just terrible frankly, almost no one plays it anymore and the ones that do are all hackers. No point in playing it.  Conclusion: Decent game, but you're probably better off playing a different COD, such as Black Ops or any of the more recent ones (Ghosts, Advanced Warfare), or waiting for BO3 which looks pretty damn good.  Overall - 6.5/10"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This game was piece of art when it first came out, so many improvements from Call of Duty 4. The campaign for Modern Warfare 2 was an absolute masterpiece, you continue on from Call of Duty 4, playing as different branches, with different characters, though this game does have it's moments being a bit repetative later on in the game but something new always pops up to give you a boost of interest, the graphics for this game are amazing, huge step up from COD4, the AI is improved but still has it's moments where it is completely unintelligent and has no regard for itself, animations are great, many weapons throughout the campaign to choose from, the singplayer earns a 9/10. As for the multiplayer I cannot say the same, let me start off saying that Modern Warfare 2 is only worth playing for it's singeplayer due to the fact that the multiplayer is full of hackers all day everyday, and you can risk being deranked in a specific server, that goes with saying you can be at risk for a VAC ban for claims of cheating, the multiplayer is nice and all, lot's of intense fighting, however the hackers are the main reason why multiplayer is ruined for this, so I do not recommend this game for it's multiplayer."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Beware bloody game won't let me bloody finish its Endgame; and in effect its Single Player.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,I CANT PLAY ONLINE i have windows 10 and a beast pc yet still just says not responding and black screen what the hell is going on
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,too many hackers and noob tubes in this game and all the legit players can do nothing about it because valve is too ♥♥♥♥ing stupid to fix the game to ban hackers
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Note: the following is about the single-player version. I don't play multiplayer so cannot comment on it. If you're buying it for the multiplayer, look at other reviews. If you're considering buying it for the single player, this review is meant for you. FYI.  It's so scripted that there is little to no replayability unless you enjoy doing exactly the same thing over and over and are enamoured with learning what is effectively an elaborate dance routine (shoot there, spin around, shoot there, move 2 meters, shoot there, etc.). So $/hr of enjoyment is limited. Lucky I only buy these things at massive discount Steam sales.  Overall storyline is strained. On the plus side, many of the missions are somewhat entertaining the first time around. Some are annoying as hell, apparently made to simply annoy the player, or perhaps showcase a particular element that the developers were particular proud of. None made me think 'wow, that was great'. The ending was, as with CoD4:MW, an annoying as hell tightly scripted cutscene.  Will I get the CoD:MW3? Probably, but only at a massive discount (ie: under CDN$10). Because so far the series isn't worth more than that. But for $10, it's an OK buy.  PS: You can't even turn off the repetive music. Instead, you'll have it blaring your ears while you TRY to listen for the killer dogs approaching, or footsteps behind you. There are ways to turn it off by hacking the system (well, renaming a file) but that compromises the local file integrity. Go figure.  PPS: Having now tried the multiplayer, my opinion doesn't change. The main issue is their idea of 'server selection'. As in: you don't get a choice. You are connected to the first server it finds, and servers are user-operated so anything can happen. The system does not offer a list of available servers. So if you're in a group you don't want to play with (ie: they've hacked the server so much it's useless), you're stuck, because that's the first one the game will find. Alternative services have been aggressively shut down by the distributor for some reason. As for gameplay, it's the usual mix of perfectly reasonable people with an unfortunate leavening of cheaters.   PPPS: Oh, and if you want to play around in single player, expect a LOT of issues trying to get the console working, and keeping it working. It was working, I 'resumed' a game, and now it's not working any more. Yes, I've made all the necessary changes to config.cfg, yes I've made config.cfg read-only so the damn game doesn't overwrite it with a stored copy (why in HELL have a config.cfg if there's a stored copy, I'll never understand), but it still won't bloody work. ANNOYED! Doesn't change my recommendation though, my opinion of the game was already low.  Definitely not at all recommended unless you get this game at a steep, steep discount."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Multiplayer is riddled with hackers. 9/10 would not advise to play.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"would recommend this game but, untalented/unskillful people, use noobtubes and rpgs. some people play normally, but people use rpgs and noobtubes to carry them to max prestige. ffs"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,full of hackers peice of junk game DONT BUY
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,It's okay. PvP is fun for a little while but it gets old if you don't unleash your inner 12 year old and troll it.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Filled with whiny ♥♥♥♥♥ with no grasp on ''fun''. They just want 3 digits on their kill column. This might have been fun at it's prime but now it's just cancer.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Private matches dont work
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Simple review, dont buy. Old game that is only played by noobs who just camp and do nothing to play the game. Only game mode played is TDM, which id ont mind but it sucks when you try to get into the foray only to be shot in the back by a guy corner camping. Oh and no lean ability, Infinity Ward removed it because a minority of the gaming community hated it cause the campers couldnt camp with it. Unbalanced perks, weapons and equipment like the UMP45 getting a massive boost with the suppressor and OMA giving unlimited grenade ammo for the noob tube and such. Hacking is still present though most people using it will hide it by pulling it out limitedly and the fact that VAC no longer bans players from the game which basically makes the game now garbage. Hosting is archaic with having a player host in a sort of LAN based gaming which you dont control, its like console gaming on a PC. If you have latency to the host expect to lose alot of .. everything gunfights, matches and basically even when you shoot guys in the back expect that to fail when it doesnt register and you still die. Even being host doesnt guarantee anything since you can still lag when hosting too. No control over the game, no lean ability, no hacker counter equals a game that can still be fun when played with none of the above stuff but when there are hackers and such expect a broken match and to top if off if you leave it will count as a loss and then they will toss you right back into the same match as icing on the cake."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,As my first COD game on a computer I disliked it. For fans of the series I guess it's pretty good though.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Try to think of the most fun you've had playing this game in the past with a group of friends or alone. Chilling out on the couch or at the computer and playing. Now try to imagine a bunch of tryhards noob tubing, head-glitching, and camping ♥♥♥♥♥♥ all of the casual fun out of your game without any VAC protection and a missing map since 2012. Well thats whats left on MW2 on the PC now. So keep your happy memories of this game and dont re-buy it out of nostalgia."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,So i had some fun with this in multiplayer... until i joined a server and quickly realized it was hacked and i then notice im level 70... so yeah that ruined a big chunk of the game for me and apperantly it happens alot due to my friends first game was hacked from what i know there is no way to avoid these servers but you can always prestige when you stumble upon a hacked server.. However this is not the end i suppose i can still find some enjoyment out of the game after all it is call of duty even if i wish i could get my 10 dollars back... would recomend this game on xbox and play station Not pc
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Hackers, do i have to say any more?"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"People still play 4 Game modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Hardcore Team Deathmatch and Domination (sometimes you can find Search &amp; Destroy but not usually). Most of the time you won't have a problem with TDM but any other game mode you will be waiting several minutes for Steam to setup a lobby and when you get one it will likely be laggy. I got this game on sale for 10 bucks a couple weeks ago and it was worth it... But I would definitely not recommend paying 20 bucks for this game unless you only like Team Deathmatch.   Oh, and it is full of hackers. If you can deal with people shooting you through walls when they shouldn't even know you're there then this one's for you! I would actually guess that AT LEAST 7/10 people are actually cheating in this game. Since the anti-cheat engine is disabled they don't even try to hide it anymore. Never seen such blatantly obvious hacks in a game before. I rate this game ***Fart noise*** out of 10.  UPDATE! Reverted to Windows 7, had to reinstall the game. Won't even run in Windows 7. I am not converting back to Windows 10 just to play MW2. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND YOU SAVE YOUR MONEY and don't buy this junk."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"good game BUT the minus are unbearable to ignore  -no vote system (kick,change map,ect) -full of hackers,noob tubers,kids with mental problems -no dedicated servers -no bots -expensive dlc's  ther are 'mods' out ther in the net that allows you to use vote system,dedicated servers,bots to play agenst BUT the developers are like 'dont give a f' they hunt down every modder that tryis to fix the damn game and make it better. ok i understand you dont like pirate version of the game,but this is the only way to fix this mesh,and is the only way becose you the develpers just dont give a f about the game!  how dificult it would be to just add this option to the game? if simple modders can do it,you can do it. BUT NOOO you just dont care about your game..full with hackers! you got your money so you dont care about us.  yea let them buy our new cod's, forget about mw2.NO NO NO!!! i wont buy nothing until you fix this mesh.  i mean EA Games its hated for many things we all know that.but its seams that they are not the only ones that need to be hated.for me you are just the same,you dont give a f for the players that suported you when you needed the money.  and i will say it again,HOW HARD IS TO IMPLEMENT THIS OPTIONS IN YOUR DAMN GAME?????   (sorry for my english)"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,too many cheaters
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,full of cheaters unfortunately.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I hate this game, but liked it when i was 14"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"It's Call of Duty...what more to say, just pick up a controller and play...if you can get past the 13 year olds yelling at your ear and giving your mom regards...:/"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"After first part I was expecting a lot from this, but DISSAPOINTED I was.... very."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"The best COD amongst all in my opinion but the PC version lacks many features in comparison to PS3/360 versions:  - Full controller support. - 2 local player Special Ops using split screen. - 4 local Multiplayer using split screen.  Call of Duty is, problably, the most expensive franchise ever. Many companies updated their games to the new demand and Activision didn't. Activision say that these updates in PC have many technical difficulties, come on...  I'm hopeless about a major update in COD:MW2, so I don't recommend this game because the high prize of this game (even on sale!) doesn't represent the real quality of the game (with respect to PS3/360)."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Worse in every way compared to its predecessor.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,do not buy this game after you play for a while the game will not run and i will not get of you desc top dont wast your money
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Can't play with my friends online because of a bug. (which will never be fixed)
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Endless crashes (only game that does that) + not as good as CoD4: Modern Warfare (not even close).  Score: 70 (Okay)
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,I bought this for the single player and both steam and activision will not find or help as to why it won't play in single version so if that is your idea DON'T get it .
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,my game wont load and ive tried many things to fix it but its just not working 
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Very good game , when flash bang explosives back to you you get blinded and slowed wtf is this"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Wtf Patch that ♥♥♥♥ plz noobs I cant play compaing ♥♥♥♥ing noobs!
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,not so real game :3
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"A game for 13 year olds. Boring and linear maps, incredibly imbalanced weapons, and a bad community. Oh, and no dedicated servers, just to screw you over that little bit more. Single player campaign is way too short, multiplayer takes years to get going (and is bad, anyway). Should be in the bargain bin, but they're still charging something ridiculous."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Spawned in got killed 20 times by a aimboting hacker.       Uninstall had no hackers tho, so 10/10 would uninstall again."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,HACKERS HACKERS HACKERS. But seriously the sensitivity is absolutely terrible for this game as it tries to accelerate all the ♥♥♥♥ing time.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,It was great with local servers in Australia then the cheap cod owners moved all the mandatory match making servers in asia. If you like constant lag then waste your money on this now ♥♥♥♥ game
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"You would think that at least one person would have asked a real soldier just how effective a 7.62mm round is against a soldier. This game is stupid. It takes four or five shots to eliminate a target. Can one of these programmers please demonstrate their bullet-proof cotton by standing in front of firing range and taking 5 rounds from a 5.56mm weapon. This is not a game; it'a a movie. It's scripted, it pre-destined, there is nothing the player can do to change the result. Just shoot stuff and wait for the cut-scenes.  By the way, real soldiers never say the word 'repeat' on the radio - the word repeat in an artillery fire order.  The game takes away your choice to move, to see, and to decide.  The game looks good, but it uses the amazing graphics to draw dirt, snow, and blood on your face. A wasted opportunity. It's a movie. The player has no control over the results. The end scene is excrutatingly frustrating as a boring end-of-game movie. Get the cheat codes and play the one-player levels. Disapointing."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"I remember playing this game a long time ago when it was the best COD you could play. Everything was just amazing. There were no noobtubers, hackers, little kids and more. I used to play an old alternate online version called ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥net and i remeber i it was the best thing i ever played. Nostalgia got me and I decided to buy a Steam version and I can tell you that I'm really dissapointed. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥net players were very fair and honest and there were no hackers and noobtubers. So i remember joining a server and got noobtubed in the first 5 seconds and I thought it was a joke but later on I realised i was wrong. Maybe 40% of poeple who play this game are fair and normal. Before you start ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on me and saying this is an old game I get that but I can tell you that this game is ruined. Long story short this is a game whose community has gone to ♥♥♥♥."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"The singleplayer is great, but if you want to buy this for the multiplayer like I did, don't bother. It's filled with cheaters and last I heard a VAC won't stop the cheaters from continuing playing."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Just played MW2 on 360 again, I hate this now, versus the consoles it's laggy, vacant and has ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls and the graphics look like clay."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Multiplayers is full of cheaters.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,Was a PC darling before 2 but 4 then turned it into the most popular video game in the world.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"**** TL;DR ALOT OF HACKERS INFINITY WARD/VALVE DONT CARE ANYMORE**** **** ALMOST EVERYTHING IS 'OP' IN THIS GAME THATS HOW IT WAS BALANCED****  Probably my favorite call of duty and ive been playing since launch, but there are ALOT of hackers these days and there are also people that spam grenade launchers all day, and there are people that will DDOS or kick you if they dont like you or you make them mad. It feels like every 3/10 games has a hacker on a GOOD day and it seems to get worse whenever there is a holiday (the kids are off school).Ive had entire nights of trying to play this game and every lobby has a blatent aim botter/wall hacks so i just have to play something else.Why do people hack in a old game like this?  The only time to buy this game in my opinion is when it is at 50% off MINIMUM but i have never seen it go lower than that  so you need to ask yourself: can i deal with hackers,grenade launchers,and possibly modded lobbys all day?  if yes get the game while its on sale and try to enjoy whats left of the game  if no then just skip it and just enjoy the memories of what the game used to be like and go watch a twich stream Kappa  I can not recommend the game in the state that it is in now"
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Cons. 1. No mics in lobby [i dont get that] 2. auto aimers and modders in search and destroy 3. very small community 4. i've never played campaign on xbox online multiplayer a ton 5. nothing like xbox 6. save your money. had to log 5mins in campaign menu to leave review exposing how horrible yet another COD multiplayer game is trash thanks to modders.  Just played 4 hours of online. Going to uninstall. Bought on sale for $9 and looked to see if anyone was online in the community hub before i bought it. Search and destory is full of modders and auto aimers that you can't report. They talk alot of trash about killing you 0/50 and say 'git gud'  Well i'm asking for a refund, reviewing this game and saying that this along with all of call of dutys old games is full of auto aimers that destroy and completely crap on the emersion.  DON'T BUY UNLESS YOU WANT AUTO AIMERS TO CAMP YOU IN THE SMALL COMMUNITY THEN SAY 'GIT GUD'  also use ^1-9 to color your text and display name."
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,better than the new cods but full of hackers as activion gave up on it after releasing the new crap.
